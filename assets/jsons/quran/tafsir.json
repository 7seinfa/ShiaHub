			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 1:1]\nBISMILLAHIR-RAHMANIR-RAHIM, as the first verse, is the part and parcel of al Fatihah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Holy Prophet said:\nLA SALATA ILLA BIFATIHATUL KITAB WA BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHIM MIN AYATIHA\nThere is no prayer (salat) without al Fatihah, and bismillahir rahmanir rahim is one of its verses. The Ahl ul Bayt (the thoroughly purified members of the family of the Holy Prophet), and the scholars, who follow their teachings, time and again, had verified this saying of the Holy Prophet. So according to Muhammad and ali Muhammad bismillahir rahmanir rahim is a verse by itself, which, if not recited as a part of al Fatihah, the prayer is rendered null and void. It is not only the component of al Fatihah but also of every surah except al Bara-at.\nIn the light of the clear decisions and evidences of the practical acts of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, the arguments of the dissenting scholars carry no weight. According to the Holy Prophet and his divinely chosen Ahl ul Bayt bismillahir rahmanir rahim is the first of the seven verses of al Fatihah. And when Muhammad and ali Muhammad have said so, there remains no doubt whatsoever. Any opinion contrary to the verdict of Muhammad and ali Muhammad is pure conjecture.\nAbu Hanifa, founder of the Hanafi school, gave permission to his followers to recite bismillahir rahmanir rahim quietly, with al Fatihah, in prayers, because the Holy Prophet used to recite al Fatihah with bismillahir rahmanir rahim in his prayers, yet in his (Abu Hanifa's) opinion it was not a part of the surah. (Tafsir Kabir - Abdul Hayy) There are some scholars who admit that al Fatihah consists of seven verses but to insist on their misconceived notion that bismillahir rahmanir rahim is not included in it they split the last verse into two separate verses, although the meaning and the construction of the verse does not justify it.\nAccording to the Holy Prophet any deed begun without reciting bismillah goes bad and lacks effectiveness. As al salat is known as the best deed (khayrul amal) and al Fatihah is the inaugurator of the book it is logical that bismillahir rahmanir rahim is the first verse of al Fatihah.\nOnce a man offered prayers in presence of the Holy Prophet without saying bismillahir rahmanir rahim in his recitation of al Fatihah. The Holy Prophet told him:\nYou have rendered your prayer null and void by omitting bismillah from Fatihah. Do you not know that bismillah is the part of al Fatihah? (Durrul Manthur by Suyuti)\nOn one occasion, Mu-awiyah, while leading a prayer in Madina, recited al Fatihah without bismillah. At the end the participating pray-ers, made a hue and cry. To pacify the protestations he prayed the same prayer again and recited al Fatihah with bismillah. This event bears out the fact that those who saw and heard the Holy Prophet, prior to the influx of alterations, knew that if in any prayer al Fatihah is recited without bismillah, it is rendered null and void. (Fakhruddin Razi and Kanzul Ummal)\nBismillahir rahmanir rahim, in addition to al Fatihah, is also the part of al Naml:\nVerily, it is from Sulayman; and it is 'In the name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful'. This is the beginning of the letter prophet Sulayman wrote to the queen of Shiba.\nWhatever be the point of view of the dissenting scholars, it has been decisively established that the Holy Prophet always recited bismillahir rahmanir rahim as the part of al Fatihah, therefore, we all should follow him.\nBISMILLAH\nTo start any good deed with \"(I begin) in the name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful\" means a supplication unto Allah for successful completion of the work. It also means that the supplicant undertakes the job in the name of and on behalf of Allah to serve the good in the work as well as achieve his own legitimate purpose. In other words he dedicates his life to Allah and employs his self-interest-oriented activity in the service of overall goodness. He admits his helplessness and relies on the truth that ability to make any work fruitful is exclusively with Allah, and with no one else. By invoking Allah in the name of His beneficence and mercy he prays for His aid to achieve success in his undertaking. It is quite logical to believe that the divine beneficence and mercy would bless such a faithful. It does.\nIt is a fact that nothing exists or takes effect outside the course of Allah's will. The will of Allah governs the scope of every activity but does not determine the desires and methods of any created being. Anything that happens or exists without seeking Allah's pleasure, is covered by the will of Allah, but is not blessed with His grace. Should an individual begin any work without saying bismillah, it may be completed but without earning the divine pleasure. The desires and actions of an individual shall be blessed only when he surrenders them to Allah's pleasure. The Holy Prophet has made it known that anything done without invoking the divine grace by reciting bismillah is not approved by Allah.\nAs said earlier anyone can begin any work, without invoking Allah with bismillah, and it will be executed, if the divine will allows it. However, in this event, it does not earn the divine pleasure, but on the contrary is liable to be punished according to the degree of evil involved, the intention of the individual, the nature and the effect of the work. Even if it is not evil in its nature, disciplinary action can be taken because the individual has relied upon his ability and will which is as bad as setting oneself against the almighty Lord.\nThe very act of any one starting his work in the name of Allah whom he remembers as beneficent and merciful, eloquently speaks of the individual's obedience to the supreme being, who in return would automatically be reciprocal to the devotee's expectation in seeking His pleasure and mercy. In starting a work in the name of Allah, the reciter demonstrates the undernoted aspects of fundamental importance :\n1. Acknowledgement of the supreme being as his Lord master.\n2. Confession of his own helplessness.\n3. Belief in Allah as the ever-living and all-knowing - almighty.\n4. Reliance on the supreme being, seeking His pleasure and mercy, and invoking Him with His mercy-invoking attributes.\n5. Conviction at heart and confidence that if called, the beneficent and the merciful Allah will certainly not deny him His mercy.\nThe words of bismillah i.e., in the name of Allah, have wide and discernible implications. The words may mean not only 'in the name of' but also:\n1. For the sake of\n2. To the service of\nThese and many other implications will serve the supplicant when he sincerely turns to Allah for obtaining His mercy and blessings.\nOne of the many unique features and distinguishing factors about the originality of Islam is bismillah which was never before used by or known to any of the other corrupted or falsified creeds of the world. Rodwell, wrongly informed, states that bismillah, in its Quranic form, was taught to the Quraysh for the first time by the poet Umayya (of Tayf). This claim of Rodwell is contradicted by unimpeachable evidence of historic authenticity that the term was totally unknown to the Quraysh to such an extent that they even resented the use of it (see verse 60 of al Furqan). Besides, even till as late as in the 6th year of Hijra, the Quraysh did not allow the term bismillah, as used in the Quran, to be used in the treaty drawn between the Muslims and the Makkans at Hudaybiyah. At the use of the term bismillahir rahmanir rahim Suhayl bin Amru, the delegate of the Quraysh, objected that he did not know what it meant. Ultimately the term used was bis-mika-allahumma which was then current among the Quraysh. There is no evidence in the usage of the people of other creeds to show that this term was borrowed by the Holy Prophet. Moreover, Islam does not claim to be a new religion preached for the first time to mankind. Islam's claim is that the truth was revealed to mankind, one and all, in various stages, in many languages; the difference is in the presentation of the truth in its fullness, in all its details.\nWe never sent a messenger save with the language of his people. (IBRAHIM: 4)\nALLAH\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThere is no fitting equivalent, in the English or any other language, to convey and express the essential essence of the word ALLAH. In the earlier times the idea of a \"supreme being\" was conveyed to man by the prophets of Allah, but due to the general low level of knowledge, a single word, containing the all-embracing sense and significance of the supreme, universal and absolute being, was not made known.\n\"Father\" may imply creativeness but, in no way, refers to compassion, beneficence and mercy. The word father implies that the father of the universe had a father and a mother who gave birth to him, because it does not indicate that the father of the heaven and the earth had no father or mother to bring him into being. It also fails to establish his uncreated self-existing eternity, unless explanatory words are added. The word Allah is a compound of the definite article al and the noun ilah, meaning \"that God\". The literal meaning of ilah is \"puzzling\" if waliha is the source, and \"referred to\" if it is derived from aliha; in either sense, it can be used for the supreme being unto whom man must surrender.\nKnown to every one, there is only one universal ultimate whom all human beings devotedly worship; and upon whom they depend and rely. He is undefinable, beyond the reach of human intelligence, unknowable to knowledge, unimaginable, yet recognised by one and all.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq pointed to the spirit and vision of the word Allah to an atheist, in the course of a discussion. He said:\n\"When you are in a ship, sailing in the middle of an ocean, and a wind-storm comes on from every side, and there is no conceivable means of rescue, yet, in this hopeless situation, you make efforts, in hope of deliverance; this ultimate faith is Allah, referred to by Allah in verse 22 of Yunus.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe word Allah points to that which is already in the consciousness, but cannot be arrested by comprehension, or conceived mentally. It is universal, because it is connected with the whole as well as with the part. Whether the word Allah is a proper noun or a common noun, because of the article al, is a solvable controversy. The common noun ilah, appropriating definite sense with the definite article al, referring to that which is universally known and recognised by every conscious being, unconfinable to form or concept, never to be two or more save one, becomes a proper noun.\nSo it is concised in the word Allah, giving it the unique unity of the sense of a proper noun. It must be noted that as the absolute can never be perceived by consciousness, so it cannot be defined by any name. One can refer to Him by personal pronouns, of which \"He\" (huwa) is the most suitable. The word Allah stands for the absolute self, the greatest name (ism azam), the one perfect total of all good and excellence with no defect.\nIn contemporary commentaries it is speculated that the word Allah might have been derived from the Hebrew uluhim. Allahumma is closer to uluhim than Allah, because the infidels, very intimate associates of the Jews, were more familiar with Allahumma than Allah, which was a new development. At any event what has been said earlier is further substantiated by the argument put forward to indicate the etymological development of the word.\nIn the process of evolution, the intellect of man began to make adjustments in the man-god relationship. He had been bowing in adoration to the powerful, useful, harmful, or unintelligible manifestations of nature which, step by step, developed into worship of imaginary deities. As the pantheon of man-made gods grew, man, in desperation, began to seek a supreme being, over the heads of the mini-gods, serving the chief to administer the destiny of man, in one way or other. So gradually man started to seek a supreme being with all comprehensive authority. The word Allah, more suitable than the other words, became popular among the people.\nThe two possible words ilah is derived from, are alaha and walah meaning astonishment and wonder. The word Allah is formed by adding the definite article al to alah, which means the one who is beyond the reach of conception, or even imagination, and out of the range of knowledge.\nThe quest for knowledge about Allah comes to a close when the seeker in astonishment confesses that with all his sincere efforts supported by intellect and insight he cannot know Him.\nImam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir said:\nObserve and examine the creation of Allah, do not pry into the being of Allah because no one knows what He is except He.\nImam Ali ibn abi Talib said:\nHe! O He whom none knows what He is, nor how He is, nor where He is, nor in what respect He is, but He. (Al Mashlul)\nThe name Allah stands for the supreme one who encompasses everything in the universe but nothing can encompass Him. He is the ever-living allknowing almighty. He has no equal. There is none comparable to Him. He has no associate or partner. All goodly names and ideal attributes belong to Him. He owns and controls that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth and that which is in between them, the kingdom of the universe. It is only His will that is done. He is the all-seeing, all-hearing, all-just, all-merciful. He is eternal, in"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 1:2]\nAL HAMDU\nAlhamdu means that (all) praise, thanks, gratitude, be to Allah alone, not to any one else, from the beginning of the universe to its end, not under compulsion, but because He alone, and none else, deserves to be praised, not only for the fulfilment of his particular desires but also, mainly, for all the bounties and blessings made available to man in his existence.\nThe love of the merciful for His creation is so deep and fulfilling that no compensation, even in the form of gratitude, can be offered to Him. In fact He needs no return. The divine mercy is independent of gratitude. It reaches and covers all the created beings whether the creatures show gratitude or not for the benefits and bounties they make use of and enjoy. The smallest bounty is an unconditional favour. Man does not deserve it, nor has he any right to claim any favour from the Lord. It is the all-embracing mercy of the merciful Lord which reaches one and all, whether any creature asks for it or not, whether the recipient acknowledges it or not.\nA person likes to be praised if he accomplishes or acquires something extraordinary, novel or very important, after investing his best efforts, but the good in Allah is with Him. He has not acquired it.\nHe is goodness itself in its fullness and perfection. He is not in need of praise. In a prayer, He is praised, only to make the pray-er love and cherish the attributes which are praised, because as a matter of course, he would like to possess the attributes which he is praising.\nThe all-knowing Lord-nourisher is fully aware of the needs and wants of all His creatures more than they themselves know. He bestows His favours and bounties without receiving petitions from them, yet to educate, train and discipline the mankind, prayer, in which He is praised, is necessary, so that man remains attached with the merciful creator, while enjoying the divine bounties, conscious of the absolute sovereignty of the Lord of bounties and grace.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nTo find out the truth in connection with the praise and the praising (hamd) the question as to who praises whom, must be answered. Man can praise Allah if his existence is presumed to be as eternal as Allah, whereas, in fact, it is Allah who created man and taught him how to praise. Truly, the praise as well as the praising both belong to Allah. Allah is the hamid, the praiser, and also the mahmud, the praised. There is none else other than Allah who is the subject as well as the object of the praise, and in this sense no one can share His praise. This is implied in the preposition li (for), which signifies the exclusive authorisation.\nHamd, adoration through praise, takes the place of gratitude to be expressed for getting favours and bounties. Man, by nature, shows his readiness to yield to love and compassion, even to the extent of unconditional surrender. To depend upon the co-operation and help of others is human. When he finds that someone, attached to him, is taking interest in his well-being, he is automatically drawn to him. His desire for a happy life makes him go after that which helps and protects, and avoid that which he finds harmful to his existence and welfare. By realising that praise, in any form or content, must be for Allah, and for no one else, and that Allah alone deserves every praise and adoration, man is freed from the fear of awesome tyranny, corruption and servitude which he presumed that the dreadful and false gods would inflict upon him. On the contrary now he knows that his real master is the Lord of beneficence and mercy whom he approaches through His praise . He is free to get as near to Him as he likes in order to earn more and more from the bountiful benefactor who Himself is ready to bestow favours and bounties, in abundance, on the sincere seeker and on those on whose behalf He is beseeched.\nThe Arabic word shukr implies gratitude for some particular favour, whereas hamd, without reference to any particular quality, is an objective gratitude, for all that is good and gracious, profitable and advantageous. It may also involve the idea of free, unrestricted and unqualified admiration. But, again, admiration refers to the Arabic word madh which is used both for the animate as well as the inanimate objects, without necessarily implying that existence of the qualities admired depends on the conscious will of the object, in which case admiration will relate to the qualities admired, not to the possessor of those qualities. Allah is never praised in this sense. The prefix al confirms that hamd is for no one but Allah who alone, not merely on account of the manifestations of the divine attributes, but because He is the sole owner of those glorious qualities, deserves to be praised; identifying His self-existent absolute self. The qualities belong only to Him alone, to none else, and it is so for all times since eternity, and will be so till eternity. So, in this sense the English word \"praise\" should be understood and used as a translation of hamd.\nHamd (the praise) is Allah's. It has no beginning and no end. We, the created beings, do our best, within our limitations, to give expression to the \"real praise\" (hamd). His hamd, as His grace, is unlimited and continuous. No one can praise the merciful even for a whole life-time and say that justice has been done, because every time one gives thanks to Allah he inhales and also exhales, drawing in the good life-giving air and exhaling the bad air, two bounties he is receiving for which only once can he say \"I thank the bountiful Lord\". It is impossible to thank Allah for the innumerable bounties He has put at the disposal of man, right inside his body, and in the world where he lives as an individual as well as a member of the community. Even the thanks and praises he offers to the bountiful have been taught to him by the Lord of the worlds. Therefore, every creature is, all the time under the obligation of the bountiful grace of Allah.\nBy praising, we reach the stage where the infinite goodness of our Lord purges out of us the taste for evil and creates in us the eagerness to get nearer and nearer to Him to earn His mercy which purifies us and reflects in us the divine attributes.\nRABBUL ALAMIN\nRabb in Arabic stands for nourisher, cherisher, and sustainer. According to Raghib, an Arab lexicologist, the word rabb signifies \"the fostering of a thing in such a manner as to make it attain one condition after another until its goal of completion\".\nOur Lord is He who gave unto everything its form, and then guided it aright. (TAHA; 50)\nThis is rahmah, mercy, from the rabbul alamin.\nThe love and mercy of Allah towards His creatures surpasses, in quantity and quality, the love of both the father and mother put together. From the birth to the last breath everything in the universe depends upon the rububiyat, the nourishing, cherishing, sustaining and protecting aspect of the mercy of the Lord of the worlds. No single English word to give the meaning of the word rabb could be found, but \"Lord\" seems to be the only alternative if readers remember the above noted description whenever the word \"Lord\" appears in our text.\nRUBUBIYAT\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nRububiyat speaks of another attribute - lutf , meaning tenderness and refinement in diffusing through every one's mind and feelings to know the needs and make available the necessary means of satisfaction. This position gives authority to exercise legislative powers which, in fact, justifies the establishment of the office of nabuwat and imamat.\nBy making Allah known as the rabbul alamin, Islam has disclosed the truth to mankind that He is the Lord of everything in the universe, be that human, animal, vegetable, mineral, perceptible or imperceptible, visible or invisible, near or far, in the earth or in the heavens, or in between them. With infinite power, able to do all things, the all-wise almighty creator of matter and meaning is a supreme sovereign in every aspect of His absolute authority. His independent will extends to and covers all kinds of the worlds created by Him.\nThe five \"mystic\" classifications of the worlds are as under:\n    Material or physical NASUT\n    Metaphysical MALAKUT\n    or supernatural\n    Spiritual JABARUT\n    Divine LAHUT\n    Imperceptible and GHAYBUL GHAYUB\nunknowable\nThe rububiyat begins to operate as early as the will to create a being takes effect, and continues to nurture the created being with love, care and never-ceasing vigilance, providing all its needs according to the changes it goes through. It is like a self-imposed duty to guide the creature to make conscious efforts to avoid harm and avail profit.\n\"Verily, We have created everything by (the right) measure\". (QAMAR: 49)\nThings necessary for the living beings, all over the universe, in all times, are available to satisfy various wants and needs. The quality and quantity of the \"resources\" have been determined according to the collective requirements of all that which has been created. Some things are rare, some things are plentiful, but at all events nothing is less or more. A thoughtful study of the complex of \"things\" brings the obvious fact to light that there is only one single owner master who has set the wonderfully harmonious working of the universe in motion, allowed life to be created, and in addition, enabled each and every creation to put into effect the aim of its being brought into existence.\nThe heat of the sun changes the water into a mass of fog and the wind takes it to the sky in the shape of rolling clouds and drives them over various parts of the earth; and when the stored water in the clouds melts on account of the solar glow, it rains all over the earth. The earth receives the water and grows \"food\" for all the living beings. Every being finds, all that which serves to maintain life on earth, ready, as soon as it comes into being, duly provided and arranged in the required quantity and quality. The milk, a new-born baby feeds on, is ready in the mother's breasts well in advance of its birth.\nThe merciful rabbul alamin has provided manifold bounties for the survival and happiness of the incomprehensibly large number of the members of each of the innumerable species in the universe. There is perfect harmony and undisturbable control in the continuous working of nature. Each creature, perfectly formed and fully equipped, has an inherent capacity to make use of the available \"resources of the bounties\", and obtain its own means of sustenance from one complete regular system. This orderly arrangement, according to the Quran, takes effect by means of taqdir and hidayat.\nTaqdir means \"consider a thing well; fix in measure and quantity, render possible\".\nImam Ali ibn abi Talib had said:\nAllah had conditioned and circumstanced the operation of all that has been created under precise (self) regulating laws, in the sphere of time and space, made their unlike, complex and diverse dispositions agree and fit well together, implanted and infused rhythm and balance and co-ordination in their nature, to give them the inbuilt discipline that follows an orderly system. (NAHJ AL BALAGHA)\nThe appropriate assignment of a prescribed condition is taqdir, a precise system of laws which cannot be tampered with or led astray outside its logical course by any force except by almighty Allah, who is omnipotent and able to do all things. The perfect working of the well defined plan under definite laws depends upon His justice. As the 26th verse of Ale Imran says: \"In Thy hand is all good\", the almighty Lord through these precise laws, governing the operation of creation, has provided the living beings all the opportunities to make effort and win success by relying upon them.\nThe whole complex of the immeasurable universe is working in perfect harmony, keeping the living beings inhabiting it, and the living conditions and circumstances provided for them, in co-operative accord. No one can make the slightest attempt to disturb the \"predestined nature of creation\". The law of cause and effect can never be made to stop its inevitable function. The various elements can never do otherwise than as they have been directed under the divine laws of the nature. In this sense the meaning of the word taqdir should be understood.\nHidayat means \"right guidance\". All the living beings, all over the universe, are motivated to exercise their free choice and do that which is meaningful and profitable, and avoid that which is absurd and harmful, by discovering, understanding and making use of the \"controlled by precise laws\" environment.\nTaqdir governs every natural phenomenon and hidayat directs all the activities of the living beings. Their combined application is universal. Every being in the universe is so perfectly designed that each fulfils its own individual needs from one and the same environment. But in order to refer to the particular aspect of sustenance and preservation which the nourishing and preserving Lord justly and mercifully supplies for the benefit of His creatures, a few typical examples are sufficient.\nA newly born child at once sucks the mother's breast. The roots of the plants and trees absorb from the earth only that which helps their growth, leaving out the unessential, notwithstanding its presence in the soil. As soon as a fish is born it swims. Every creature functions under the divine guidance.\nGlorify the name of your Rabb (the Lord) the most high;\nHe who creates then fashions in the proportion.\nAnd He who has planned, then guided, (A'LA: 1, 2, 3)\nThe whole universe has been designed, created and guided (to function according to the divine laws) by one single authority who is eternal., almighty, all-knowing, all-just, benevolent and merciful.\nThe perfect u"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 1:4]\nMALIKI YAWMID DIN\nAllah is the master of the day of faith, or the day of the final judgement.\nHe who sits in judgement is known as a judge. The Arabic word is qadi. Here the word qadi is not used because qadi is not the law-giver or lawmaker, but only an executor of the law made and enforced by some other authority, and therefore, is restricted by the judicial system in force. The malik or the master is the law-maker as well as the executor of His own laws. With the supreme powers of a law-maker He uses His discretion not only in passing the judgement but also in carrying it out, according to the merits of each individual case and in view of His own satisfaction, in the light of explanations given by the accused. When an accused is proved guilty, the qadi cannot grant pardon or remission of punishment but the malik can grant amnesty to the petitioner at His own independent discretion which cannot be challenged.\nA master, who is also the beneficent, the merciful and the Lord-nourisher, would naturally be just as well as kind and compassionate when He sits in judgement over His own created, nourished and protected creatures. The justice, strict application of law to requite according to the deeds, will be modified by blending mercy with it. Only those, found unpardonable, not deserving to receive the benefit of His benevolence, will suffer the penalty. This aspect of the nature of the master of the day of final judgement has been revealed through the holy name rabb, to keep man alert against the strict justice and at the same time keep him hopefully expectant of the divine mercy.\nThe maliki yawmiddin gives fair warning to mankind to anticipate strict justice, the rahmanir rahim rabbul alamin gives hope to expect mercy. So Islam prevents terror and cruelty and give currency to love and sympathy in order to change man's conduct for the better. The divine plan had been set in motion through the Holy Prophet as the \"mercy unto the worlds\".\n\"Say: O My servants who have been inordinately immoderate in their actions to hurt themselves, despair not of the mercy of Allah. Verily Allah forgives all sins. Verily He is the oft-forgiving, the merciful.\" (ZUMAR: 53)\nAli, the first holy Imam, has composed several prayers, masterpieces of literature, to be recited to invoke the merciful Lord. One such masterpiece is the well-known Dua al Kumayl.\nO my Allah, my master, my RABB!\nCan Thou really see that I am thrown into the fire, notwithstanding my belief in Thy unity; inspite of Thy awareness thoughtfully perceived by me,\nThy praise eloquently pronounced by me, my soul abounding with Thy love; and despite my sincere confession and invocation, stooping low before Thy Lordship? Far be it from Thee!\nThou art too generous to abandon him whom Thou has nourished. (AL KUMAYL)\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe actual malik (master) is He who exercises absolute authority over everything in His possession. Everything owes its existence to Him He is the absolute. Therefore, the use of the term \"master\" for the possession and the right of possession (malikiyyat), or power and authority (mulukiyyit) is true and real in the case of Allah only. For others it would be only figurative and unreal. This is also strictly applicable to all His other attributes.\nYAWMIDDIN\nWhat man today, in this life, believes and disbelieves, will be laid bare on the day of faith. The believers and the disbelievers will witness the truth manifested before them. His reward to the righteous believers and His punishment to the wicked disbelievers will be announced. Both will thereafter live through the recompense requited by the maliki yawmiddin. Therefore, the day of faith, in fact, is the day of judgement, or the day of reckoning.\nThere will be a day of judgement or requital, but it does not exclude Allah's authority to reward and punish while life, prior to the promised day, goes on. It is one of the aspects of the infinite mercy that the act of judging is continuous. This aspect serves as a warning to keep man on the right path, or to encourage him to return to it if he drifts or goes astray. The day of judgement is the day of final requital.\nThe life after death is the continuation of the life in this world, to be lived in paradise or hell, in view of the good or evil done here. As you sow so shall you reap. At every stage of existence the divine judgement stays operative.\nThe Holy Prophet advised his followers:\nKeep on judging your conduct to make yourself ready for the (final) judgement and assess your deeds continuously ahead of the (final) assessment.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nYawm (day), mentioned in the Quran, is not, on every occasion, the day of the earth, from sunrise to sunset. It can be a moment or a period of time extending even to fifty thousand years as per verse 4 of al Ma-arij.\nTherefore, according to the context in which it is used, the day may be of an indefinitely small or long period of time, not what we understand in terms of the orbit of the earth around the sun.\nA thorough study of the Quran shows that whenever movement is mentioned, the downward course, or things descending from Allah to the terrestrial realm, are described as \"night\"; and the upward course, or things ascending towards Allah, are described as \"day\". The descending course is also described as nuzul.\nThe blowing of the trumpet (nufkhus sur; will breathe (spirits) into forms. All the creatures will take their final shape. The influence of time and space which separate one creature from the other will be removed. All will be brought together. It was He from whom everyone had come forth and unto Him every one shall return through the agency of the grace and guidance of (His) rububiyat. Each shall take up the position he or she is entitled on merit. Din is stipulated as such with reference to the yawmid din. Thus the masterdom of the malik assumes complete manifestation.\nO man! Verily you are striving unto your Lord (with) a striving and are about to meet Him. (INSHIQAQ: 6)\nAnd what will make you know what yawmiddin shall be?\nAnd what will make you know what yawmiddin is?\n(It is) a day on which no soul shall own anything (helpful) for any (other) soul; the absolute (supreme) command on that day shall be Allah's. (INFITAR: 17 - 19)\nThe ultimate, absolute and real authority belongs to Allah who is the first as well as the final cause of all creation. All the other authorities are unreal and imaginary. Therefore, the normal course to be adopted by man is that which has been stated above - striving unto the Lord.\nThis is the day when people will stand before Allah, the Lord cherisher of the worlds (TATFIF: 6).\nThis day cannot be taken as a day of any duration. It shall be a day which will not be followed by any night.\nThe human beings would discard virtue and indulge in evil, employing immorality and tyranny to perpetrate all kinds of heinous crimes and destroy peace and harmony, essential for a normal and orderly life in this world, if they do not know and believe that there is an all-just authority to question, judge and punish the evil-doers. Therefore belief in the life after death and the yawmiddin is rooted in the basis of Islamic teachings.\nWhat! Do those who commit evil suppose that We shall make them as those who believe and do good, that equal shall be their life and their death? Bad is their judgement. And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth, and that every soul shall be recompensed (according to) what it has earned. And they will not be unjustly treated. (JATHIYAH: 21, 22)\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 1:5]\nIYYAKA\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAll creatures, irrespective of social position or authority, in like manner, must submit to His will, and obey and worship Him. They have to seek His help in every activity. No one, not being equal to Him, is left out or exempted from His service. All are His servants. He is the original creator and the supreme law-giver. Every thing is created by Him, therefore, it has to abide by the laws He has made. No finite being can claim the rank of a god nor anyone can worship any finite being as a god, and also there is no room for ta-addud, the numeration of the infinite. The infinite is absolute and the finite is composite (a creature).\nNA-BUDU\nWorship is not mere carrying out some ritual. In thought and action \"Thee alone we worship\" is an unconditional commitment to the service of Allah, and none else, in order to live and die as it would please the Lord-master. The devotee puts an obligation upon himself to serve only Allah and none else. It creates an essential spirit of faithfulness to the only real master, and sets him free from the fear and subjugation of all the false authorities. The faithful servant, consequently, invokes the master's pleasure to obtain the fulfilment of his needs and wants, because he expects nothing from anyone else except from the real master whom he serves exclusively. This declaration is also a source of total satisfaction, as the devotee vows to live and die as Allah wills, and not as he himself prefers.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nMan owes loyalty to none but Allah, and true loyalty demonstrates itself by making him do nothing but carry out the will and command of the master, abide by His instructions, and represent His pleasure. To pay homage to or bow down before even a stone by His order, or to seek help through the means approved and established by Him is, in fact, His worship, because it is in conformity with the loyalty a servant owes to his master. To employ ways and means, in contravention to His orders, even to worship Him, is disloyalty.\nSo far Allah has been referred to as He, His, and Him, third person singular pronouns. Now one feels that one is standing in the presence of the absolute, so it is time to address Him in the second person singular by using the word iyyaka which means \"Thee alone\" and none else, the negation of everything else other than Him and the assertion of the Only One. The created being, as an individual, disappears, and makes an appearance as a member of the community of the fellow creatures, a unique characteristic of the religion of Islam which unites individual and collective behaviour in perfect harmony to promote the cause of humanity.\nNo community or society of individuals can serve the Lord-master without an Imam (guide). It is also true that no one can be installed in this position except the person who represents His universal grace. Therefore the almighty Allah had sent the Holy Prophet as the \"mercy unto the worlds\". The reach and scope of the Holy Prophet's mission is as all-inclusive as Allah's rububiyat, which, of course, had established his finality (khatamiyat). According to some authentic traditions, the Holy Prophet, during the ascension (mi-raj), led the prayers attended by all the prophets and messengers of Allah, who had been sent, before him, as the representatives of the almighty Lord to guide mankind, together with the angels, which, again, had instituted his supreme leadership (imamat kubra). The institution of a supreme leader, to guide mankind in its collective obedience to and worship of the Lord of the worlds, is the basis of the essential Islamic form of government, approved by Allah. It means that absolute sovereignty is in the hands of Allah and it cannot be delegated to any one but to the person who represents His universal will and grace, who is in communion with Him, and who knows the relation of the infinite to the finite and the interrelationship between the finite beings.\nSeek they other than the religion of Allah, when unto Him submits whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and unto Him they shall be returned. (ALI IMRAN: 83)\nHe is Allah, the creator, the master, the fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him, and He is the mighty, the wise. (HASHR: 24)\nThere is none in the heavens and the earth but must come unto the beneficent as a servant. (MARYAM: 93)\nKeeping to the norm of the universal submission, man must also submit and surrender his will to Allah's will, and seek help from no one but Him. The Quran, in view of the execution and regulation of Allah's will, in the operation of creation, guides mankind to learn from the \"book of creation\".\nThis verse throws light on the doctrines of determinism and free-will, a controversial issue in philosophy, theology, ethics and jurisprudence. The act of obedience and seeking help prove that human being exercise freedom of choice, and, therefore, are responsible for their actions, because they are not passive targets of Allah's activity, but have been given free-will by Allah to make their own decisions and act upon them. Their free-will and its outcome are conditioned by Allah's will, order and providence. The will of Allah does not directly determine the deeds of creatures, making the creatures' will entirely ineffective, in which case they would not be responsible for their actions, as the determinists say. It is true that the creatures cannot exercise absolute free-will because their actions and judgements have to abide by the laws created and enforced by the will of Allah as explained earlier while making clear the meaning of the word taqdir. As Imam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir has said there is no predetermination as far as the activity of the created beings is concerned but every action is conditioned by the laws, made by Allah, operating the creation, so there can be no unbridled use of freedom. It is a conciliation between freedom of action and complying with the will of Allah.\nIn the Quran the predominance of Allah's will is mentioned to point out the overall supremacy of the laws made and enforced by Allah; and also the freedom of choice granted to man is confirmed to make it clear that although living beings have the freedom to do what they will, shouldering the responsibility of their actions, they cannot do away with the will of Allah. In common terminology it is a via media. Allah's activity can be described as \"action\", and the activity of the creature as \"reaction\". There cannot be a \"reaction\" without an \"action\". And if there is no \"reaction\" the action would be considered unproductive. In this sense Allah's action operates in the realm of creation to which the creatures, consciously or unconsciously, willingly or unwillingly, react. The action is conditioned by the nature of the \"actor\". The divine action, the outcome of Allah's boundless grace, can be nothing but pure good, but the reaction of the finite creature may take a different course and produce evil for which the bad receptivity of the finite creature should be held responsible. The Quran says:\nWhatever good befalls you (O man) it is from Allah, and whatever of evil befalls you, it is from yourself; (NISA: 79)\nIt is logical as well as profitable to seek help only from Allah whom the supplicant has accepted as his rabb, and has undertaken to serve Him only, because the infinite mercy of the merciful Lord will be available to the seeker of help in proportion to the sincerity of his commitment. Through this prayer, the pray-er, in all his prayers, invokes the divine mercy, and even if the desired relief is apparently delayed or withheld, he gets the satisfaction that petition has been put forward to the proper authority who alone knows what is best for the invoker, in his own interest. As only light, not darkness comes forth from the light, so the withholding of mercy of the merciful Lord should never be misunderstood as indifference or pitilessness, because inadequate and faulty conjectures cannot comprehend the infinite wisdom of the all-wise Lord.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 1:6]\nIHDINAS SIRATAL MUSTAQIM\nA true believer in the truth, however learned and wise he may be, has to pray for this blessing from the all-knowing and all-wise Lord. Man needs guidance not only to have knowledge of the theory and practice of the doctrine he believes in, but also to perceive the extraordinary truths which open up new spiritual horizons.\nThe right path, mentioned here, is neither any particular path nor the doctrines of the religion. There are several angles of human life in this world. The physical, mental, moral and spiritual aspects of living, together with its many divisions, need guidance to find the right path. The guidance to the right path mentioned in the Quran encompasses all aspects of the various paths open to the human soul in this life. To fulfil the purpose of his creation, which is the ultimate purpose of man's existence in this world, he prays to the creator for spiritual assistance to keep him on the right path.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nllyyaka na-budu wa iyyaka nasta-in is the norm of human activity. Man must obey Allah's will, and seek His help, which also is obedience to Him. Human life is a striving to reach the absolute perfection, Allah. However perfect man's attainment be in this direction, it will still be finite. Only the infinite is absolute perfection. The distance between the infinite and the finite is infinite. Man's effort and strive in the way to perfection, by perpetual obedience and quest for help and guidance, should be continuous, then alone he can keep to the right path which leads to Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 1:7]\nSIRATAL LADHINA AN-AMTA ALAYHIM\nThe right path has been clearly defined, unmistakable in meaning, positive in application. Any path, fancied and chosen by man, individually or collectively, according to this verse, is not the right path. The right guidance, identified beyond doubt, has been made available to mankind. To follow the path of the divinely guided guides, on whom Allah has bestowed His bounties, is the right guidance. Their path leads to the divine grace. It satisfies the essential fulfilment of those who desire to always remain rightly guided. Attached with the rightly guided guides, man must rely upon their model righteousness to give form and meaning to the life spent in this world. The rightly guided guides are only those whom Allah Himself has thoroughly purified:\nVerily, Allah intends but to keep off from you uncleanness O you Ahl ul Bayt, and purify you with a thorough purification. (AHZAB: 33)\nThe essential prerequisite for following the path of an ideal, worthy of imitation, is to love the cherished model with heart and soul. To serve this necessity the almighty Allah and His Holy Prophet have enjoined the love of the Ahl ul Bayt, the thoroughly purified and divinely chosen guides, who show the right path.\nSay you (O Muhammad): \"I ask of you no recompense therefor, save love of (my) relatives (Ahl ul Bayt).\" And who earns good, We increase for him (more) good therein, verily Allah is oft-forgiving, thankful. (SHURA: 23)\nLove and attachment with the chosen guides, the Ahl ul Bayt, is known, in the religious doctrines of the original Islam, Shi'ism, as tawalla.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nWherever you turn you shall find (only) His manifestation. (BAQARAH; 115)\nTherefore, it may be said that all paths lead to Him, whether the path is straight or curved. Though it is true that every creation, in some way or the other, is His manifestation, yet that which is closer to His essence in comprehensiveness and gives a better vision of His unity, absoluteness and omnipotence, is more effective in making clear His supreme being. To follow the track of such manifestations is, in fact, itself the right path, which has been instituted by the almighty Allah as the true guidance.\nA sure and clear view of the straight path is possible when there is a model or a guiding example. The Quran identifies it as the path of those on whom Allah has bestowed His bounties.\nWho so obeys Allah and the messenger (Muhammad), they are with those upon whom Allah has bestowed favours, of the prophets, and the truthful, and the witnesses, and the righteous; and the best are they as companions!\n(NISA: 69)\nWhereby Allah guides him who follows His pleasure, into the ways of peace, and brings them out of darkness unto light by His grace (will), and guides them to the right path. (MA-IDAH: 16)\nThough His bounties are the outcome of His universal grace (rahmaniyat), encompassing all His creatures,\n\"My grace (mercy) embraces all things\", (ARAF: 156),\nyet out of His rahimiyat He has chosen the prophets, the truthful, the witnesses, the righteous, and those who follow their footsteps, in letter and spirit, as His friends. Even those who had been thoroughly purified by Allah and whose path has been described as an ideal for the whole mankind, had always turned to Allah because the (two bows' length or nearer) distance, between theirs and the infinite beings' perfection, was visible to them only. So man must aspire to rise higher and higher, then only he becomes aware of the distance and submits unconditionally to the supreme being.\nThe gift of mental, moral and spiritual perfection, the real favour and true bounty, which enables man to avoid sin, is indicated in this verse. It also identifies the perfect beings whose purity had never been corrupted by any evil of any kind, from the beginning to the end of their life on this earth. Such men of ideal purity, who knew why and how the universe was created by Allah and the laws which govern its operation, therefore, did not commit any mistake, in thought and action, are called ma-sumin (infallible). They are only fourteen in Islam- the Holy Prophet and his divinely chosen twelve successors, and Fatimah, the daughter of the Holy Prophet. In addition, the prophets and the messengers of Allah, who had been sent before the Holy Prophet, are also ma-sum (infallible).\nWhen Allah asks mankind to necessarily follow the path of those upon whom He has bestowed His bounties, it is a must that there always should be, till the end of the world, people on whom He bestows His bounties, who are destined to be the ideal, testified models of righteousness, on the earth. These men cannot be but those who should, of course, be like and comparable to the Holy Prophet in purity, wisdom and that which made the Holy Prophet the khayrul bashr, the best among mankind; otherwise without the availability of the model, the command to follow in its footsteps would be an injustice. This verse proves, beyond doubt, the existence of an Imam in every age, uptil the day of judgement.\nTo know about whom the Quran says \"he who is the best in knowledge and wisdom\", the divinely guided guide, read the following verses:\nVERSE 269 IN BAQARAH.\nVERSE 55 IN MA-IDAH.\nVERSE 35 IN YUNUS.\nVERSE 16 IN RA'D.\nVERSE 9 IN ZUMAR.\nVERSE 26 IN MULK.\nThese verses guide the seeker of truth to find out the essential qualities a religious leader or a spiritual guide must possess, and then to select his leader, without fear or favour, because,\n\"there is no compulsion in religion\" (BAQARAH: 256).\nFreedom of choice has been given to man as a test and a trial, after revealing the truth which teaches to distinguish between good and evil. The Quran does not mention names but only describes qualities in order to give the seeker of truth an open opportunity to exercise his freedom of choice.\nHe to whom wisdom is given, he truly has received abundant good. (BAQARAH: 269)\nBesides, \"I and Ali are of the 'one and the same' light\", and \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\", there are several traditions (see \"Essentials for the readers of the Holy Quran\" from page 1 to 7) which clearly make known the unique position of Ali in Islam. Through these traditions Muhammad and Ali have been proved to be the same in physical and spiritual purity. The meaning of this verse, in the light of other verses, is that to be guided aright, one should, in the absence of the Holy Prophet, follow Ali, and the divinely chosen genuine guides among his progeny, because while departing from this world the Holy Prophet gave his last and final guidance to all his followers, for all times:\nI will soon be called back, so I will have to go away from you, but I leave behind, among you, the thaqalayn (two weighty indispensable influential authorities), the book of Allah and my Ahl ul Bayt. Should you be attached to these two, never, never shall you go astray, after me, for verily these two will never be separated from each other; and, joined together, they shall meet me at kawthar.\nThe Holy Prophet and the Holy Imams are the models. Their personal purity, according to verse 33 of al Ahzab, from the moment of their arrival in this physical world to their departure, had been the unquestionable manifestation of the glory of the divine purity. Through verse 177 of al Baqarah, man is directed to follow the path of those whose piety has been described therein. They are the Ahl ul Bayt.\n\"My Ahl ul Bayt are like the ark of Nuh. Who so gets into it is saved; and who so stays away is drowned and lost,\" said the Holy Prophet.\nThe privilege of receiving direction by means of wahi, or revelation, a special medium of communicating the divine will, through the agency of an angel-messenger (Jibra-il) to the prophets and messengers of Allah, who had to convey the divine message in verbatim, was brought to an end after the Holy Prophet, the last of Allah's messengers. No angel did ever come to any one after the last prophet, Muhammad, with any message whatsoever from Allah.\nWahi, through the messenger-angel, had been sent only to a messenger of Allah, endowed with a thorough purity, which alone could sustain, carry and convey it. No human being, who does not possess the essential cleanliness, is in a condition to bear the divine revelation conveyed through angelic agency, unless Allah Himself purifies him with a thorough purification. Only that substance which is inherently pure in its innate genesis and particularly moulded, with a purpose in view, can hold up the energy and reproduce it in the same tone. All the prophets were the true messengers of Allah but each had a different receiving capacity, therefore, the Holy Prophet was not only the last of the prophets of Allah but also stood high and distinguished amongst the divinely chosen messengers, because in purity, strength and wisdom he was the ultimate model designed by Allah.\nThese messengers, We have exalted some of them above some others; of them are some unto whom Allah has spoken, and some He raised many degrees, (BAQARAH: 253)\nNow, a new school of thought, in an attempt to make up an excuse for the continuation of prophethood, puts forward several untenable arguments based upon conjectures. It is said that the divine favours of guiding a human soul, through wahi, can be bestowed on any one upto the day of judgement. No one can deny that the divine guidance through revelation may continue as long as Allah wills. The word wahi literally means a mental awakening to an idea. Also any one may conceive any idea but this wahi cannot be said to have been revealed to him from Allah.\nAnd verily satans do inspire (yuwhuna) their friends to dispute with you. (AN-AM: 122)\nSo Shaytan also, through his own methods, \"inspires\" his friends, but the confused simpletons are led to believe that the wahi is from Allah.\nThe wahi from Allah, known as ilham, through inspiration, guides those whom He chooses. The chosen being may be a man, or even a bee.\nAnd your Lord inspired (awha) the bee: Choose habitations in the hills and in the trees and in that which they thatch; (NAHL: 69)\nIt cannot be a sensible argument to say that by receiving wahi from Allah, a bee becomes the messenger of Allah.\nOnly when a meaningful message is conveyed through the agency of the messenger-angel, Jibra-il, a person can claim to be the messenger of Allah. This method of divine communication had been terminated after the Holy Prophet, Muhammad, therefore, he is the last messenger of Allah.\nThis day I have perfected for you, your religion, and have completed My favour on you, and chosen for you Islam (to be) the religion; (MA-IDAH: 33)\nWhen Allah, the Quran, as the source of the law and practice of the faith, the procedure of prayers, and the qiblah are the same, and Allah has perfected the religion, completed the favour and finally named the religion, why should any one feel the necessity of a new messenger, and for what purpose Allah would summon the messenger-angel to go to any person if there is no new message to be added to His already perfected, completed and final book? Although many impostors have come and gone with false claims to prophethood, but, in truth, as explained above, there is no necessity of a messenger after the Holy Prophet, Muhammad, nor any messenger will come, in future, till eternity.\nGHAYRIL MAGHDUBI ALAYHIM WALADDALLIN\n\"Not (the path) of those inflicted with Your wrath, nor (the path) of those gone astray\" is an explanatory clause of the 7th verse. The supplicant gives expression to his dislike and aversion for those who have rebelled against the divine authority and gone astray, and earned the wrath of Allah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThere is no need to take ghayril maghdubi as the qualifying adjectival clause for the personal pronoun alayhim, or the relative pronoun alladhina, as Zamaqshari says, because an-amta alaykim is a restriction. Therefore, these two clauses should be taken as appositional clauses in the negative form. Ghayril maghdubi and waladdallin are those who have deviated from the right path, to follow which has been made obligatory by Allah, and by overstepping the prescribed limits have gone astray. By doing so they have earned the wrath of Allah. Those who neither fall short of and lag behind (taqsir), nor overstep the boundaries (ghulu), in fact, walk on the right path of the Holy Prophet. The Jews are said to be in the category of maghdubi, as an example of taqsir, and the Christians in the category of dallin, as an example of ghulu, but truly, those who fall short of and lag behind in the matter of carrying out Allah's commands are included in the maghdubi and those who overstep the boundaries and transgress the limits, laid down by Allah, are included in the dallin.\nThe Holy Prophet who, according to the Quran, \"neither errs, nor is deceived, nor he speaks of (his own) desire\", positively asked his followers to adhere to and abide by the guidance his Ahl ul Bayt (Ali and his descendants) would reveal and demonstrate, after him, as his divinely chosen successors. Who so, among his ummah, makes less their divinely set up position, renders himself liable to be grouped with the maghdubi; and who so elevates and exalts the men of ordinary character to higher status of spiritual guides, not confirmed by Allah and His prophet, renders himself liable to be joined with the dallin. Likewise those who glorify the prophets and their successors as gods are also con"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:2]\nDHALIKAL KITAB\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nDhalika (that), a demonstrative pronoun, refers to something distant, but, in Arabic, sometimes is also used to indicate a highly revered object, even if it is close at hand. This book, the word of Allah, in the sphere of revelation, is complete, comprehensive, sublime and worthy of reverence, in the highest possible degree. Therefore, here and in many other sentences dhalika is used to refer to this holy book; and tilka, the feminine gender of dhalika, is used to refer to its verses. Whether translated as this or that, it refers to that which is in our hands.\nAL KITAB\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAl kitab, the book, has been named Quran, derived from the verb qura-a, which means to recite or to read. Therefore, the literal meaning of Quran is recitation, in the light of verses 16 to 19 of al Qiyamah, and in view of verse 185 of al Baqarah, it is a guidance with clear proofs, and a distinction.\nIt is furqan - that which teaches us to distinguish between good and evil, according to verse 1 of al Furqan, on account of its containing the principles of good and evil, and also the conditions of reward and punishment. It is also called furqan because of its gradual delivery, part by part, according to verses 106 and 107 of Bani Israil. According to verse 9 of al Hijr, it is dhikr, the reminder.\nAl kitab is hakim (a decisive book of divine wisdom), aziz (a unique book of natural beauty), hamid (praiseworthy), majid (glorious), karim (bounteous and honoured) and mubin (clear and expressive).\nIt is also ummul kitab, the mother book. The application of this title is with regard to the clear revelations, beyond all ambiguity (ayat ul muhkamat) - they are the substance of the book as per verse 7 of Ali Imran, in the light of which the rest of the book is explained.\nThere are many other substitute expressions of the above noted description of al kitab, mentioned in the verses of the Quran, some of which have been listed on page 1. Also many important aspects of the book have been discussed in the \"essentials for the readers of the Quran\", from page 1 to 7.\nThe Quran has been specified as the book, as well as, the word or sentence of Allah. The book and the word are the vehicles of thought and will. When the expression of thought or will, or both, are written, giving stability and simultaneity to the components, it is a book, whereas the word is only the spoken expression. Although the expression, whether written or spoken, is attributable to the knowledge and the ability of the author or speaker, it is absurd to refer to the work of the author or speaker as his attribute, because knowledge or ability, and not its outcome, is the attribute.\nIn normal sense, the word is produced by highly organised functions of the vocal organs of living beings; and a book is the result of the elaborate labour of man's hand, pen, paper and ink etc. This does not apply to the word and the book of Allah. According to Imam Ali ibna abi Talib, the word of Allah is not a spoken expression in the sense of sound but is a divine will. He said:\nIt is not a sound that strikes the ear, nor a voice to be heard. Verily His words are His work, originated by Him.\nHis work, originated by Him, had stability and simultaneity prior to its gradual delivery to the visible world; and after the appearance in the lowest sphere of manifestation, this stable and simultaneous work became His book. Therefore, it has continuity, in the order of descent, by the continuity of His will. In view of these two aspects, all that has been created (the whole and its parts) is His word, the effect of His creative will. On account of its stability and the simultaneity of its parts the whole creation is a book of Allah i.e. the written expression of His will and thought.\nGenerally, the endurance of the written expression does not depend upon the existence of its author, or the continuity of his attention. But the relation between the created and the creator, as pointed out by the Quran, is like the ray of light to its source; the reaction to the action; the reflection to the radiation; the speech to the continuity of attention and the will to speak; or the mental process to the attention. Also, as the speech is related to the speaker, so too the genesis, survival, continuity and simultaneity of the parts of every finite being is related to the continuity of the attention and will of the infinite, the creator. Viewing the creation from this angle, it is the word of Allah. Therefore, the effect or outcome of the divine will and knowledge is the book, as well as, the word of Allah.\nAllah is the absolute and the ultimate authority in the domain of creation (what is), as well as, in the domain of legislation (what ought to be). In the \"what is\", there is no place for the will of the creature. In the \"what ought to be\", the will of the creature operates as a reaction. With reference to the \"what is\", the book of Allah is the kitab ul takwini. In connection with the \"what ought to be\", it is the kitab ul tashri-i. The source of both the books, the takwini and the tashri-i (under the process of tanzil, the gradual delivery), is with Allah, immeasurable, but the revealed form, He had sent down, is in a known measure (see verse 21 of al Hijr). Nazul or the revelation is a term applied in the Quran to the process of descent from the infinite to the finite, in creation as well as in legislation. The divine revelation, in legislation, passes through the same stages of intellectual, angelical and non-material agencies, as it does in creation. In creation, the last stage of revelation is that when it is exposed to our senses, termed as alam shahadat (the visible world), and alam malak (the world of cause and effect). In legislation the last stage of revelation is the heart (power to visualise) of the Holy Prophet, prior to its utterance. Therefore, this revelation (legislation) is in complete conformity with the revelation regarding creation.\nImam Ali ibna abi Talib says:\nAlthough you see yourself as a \"nothing to speak of\" origin, in you is summed up the vast universe; and, therefore, you are the meaningful book whose words make clear the unknown.\nThus man is the synthesis of kitab ul takwini, or a brief summary of the universe, a microcosm (alam saghir), and the universe is a universal man (insan ul kabir). Each can be viewed in the light of the other. This is only applicable to a man who has reached the superlative sphere of intellectual attainment and is capable of direct communion with the absolute, which is the highest stage of obedience (ububiyat). It is applicable to the last prophet of Allah. And it is applicable to those whom he had identified with himself in such attainment. It is unanimously agreed and universally acknowledged by all schools of Islam that the Holy Prophet did not identify anyone with himself nor himself with anyone save Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn and the other nine Imams of his house.\nThe Holy Prophet had said:\nI and Ali are from \"one and same\" divine light.\nThe first of us is Muhammad,\nthe middle of us is Muhammad,\nthe last of us is Muhammad,\nevery one of us is Muhammad.\nNext to the Holy Prophet and those mentioned above, are the other prophets and messengers of Allah, according to their various degrees of attainment. To each of them the word and the book of Allah, in the realm of legislation, had been revealed, keeping in view their respective degree of attainment as the microcosm and purposeful book of creation. The higher a prophet was in his attainment, the more comprehensively was the word and the book revealed to him. The last prophet, in his ascent, reached the maximum stage of qaba aw adna (two bows length, or even nearer - Najm:9), therefore, the word and the book revealed to him was the most comprehensive, the most expressive, and the final revelation, tammat kalimatu rabbika sidqan wa adla (and perfect is the word of your Lord in truth and justice) - See verses 115 and 116 of al An-am.\nWhile explaining the word and the book, in their origin and in the various stages of their revelation down to the visible world, the process of descent from the infinite to the finite and from the absolute unity to manifold multiplicity has been dealt with. Now it must be mentioned, as pointed out earlier, that the process of creation is circular in nature, and all that which has been created should return to the original source, therefore, the ascent, from the finite to the infinite, and from multiplicity to unity, necessarily follows the same stages of the descent in reverse.\nHe regulates (all) affairs from heaven to the earth; then it shall ascend unto Him.\n(SAJDAH: 5)\nAlso refer to verse 2 of al Saba, and verse 11 of al Rum.\nWhatever comes into existence in the lowest realm, be it a substance, an accident, or an action, appears in the highest in a refined form, or correspondingly retains its refined impression. These impressions may be termed as the divine books of the hereafter (kutub ma badut tabiyy) i.e. books post-physical, in the same way as the impressions present in the process of revelation, prior to the visible world, may be termed as book pre-physical. The origin and the absolute reality behind the phenomenon, the universe, in all its stages and phases, is identified with the infinite excellence. Therefore, it must be said that the stages, in both the arcs of descent and ascent, together with their contents, closer to the infinite, are more real than the stages further from the absolute. In fact the lower stages are the impressions, images and reflections of the real entities in the higher stages.\nAnd there is not a thing but with Us are its treasures, and We do not send it down but in a known measure.\n(HIJR: 21 )\nIn the initial stages of contemplation, the things perceptible to the senses look real, and all that which is out of sight (beyond perception) appears to be imaginary, but when the intellectual observation and vision grasps the above view point and reaches beyond, this state of mind will give the impression of unreality and the ideas beyond take the shape of reality. So, the things which appear in the sensual realm are merely of an illusory nature, unreal; because their reality lies in the realm beyond. This imperative condition is applicable to the book of creation (kitab ul takwini), the visible phenomenon of creation, as well as the revealed book of legislation (kitab ul tashri-i). To deny the existence of the Quran, or the other sacred scriptures, prior to their advent in their visible form, means the denial of the proceeding of the universe from the infinitely perfect absolute. It would be an unreasonable denial based upon a negative approach (from the imperfect to the perfect and from the unconscious to the conscious), because the basis of pure scientific investigation is that \"a thing cannot come out of nothing.\" Or were they created by nothing? (Tur: 35) The truth that whatever appears in the visible world has had a pre-existence in some form in the book (the unseen world), as stated in verse 22 of al Hadid, has to be accepted.\nThe Quran, in verses 38 and 39 of al Rad says that \"for every term (age) there is a book (a written record) prescribed; (of it) Allah effaces what He wills, and confirms (what He wills); and with Him is the mother of the book (basic source).\" It means that for every fixed term or period there is a book which is subject to change. Also for every soul and for every community there is a book (see verse 10 of al Munafiqun) and each of these has two books, the book prior to its existence and the book after its existence (see verses 27 and 28 of al Jathiyah, and verses 13 and 14 of Bani Isra-il). All these partial books, dealing with conduct and character and various aspects, prior to or after the visible appearance, are included in the ummul kitab, which is with Allah (see verses 38 and 39 of al Rad), represented here by the Quran which is ummul kitab, as well as, kitab ul mubin. Therefore, all references to al-kitab indicate the Quran either in its revealed form or in its form prior to revelation.\nThe Quran is the sum total of the word and the book of Allah. It is the map of the universe. Its letters, words, clauses, sentences, chapters, parts, and symbols, jointly or severally, signify the facts of the creation in its circular process. To read and understand any map, a fixed scale is required, without which it would be a meaningless mass of unrelated and irrelevant dots and lines having no value or significance. Therefore, in the case of the Quran, those who do not make use of the \"real scale\", remain unattached, go astray and wander in the wilderness of ignorance and confusion. The Quran refers to this fact.\n\"Verily, We sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the book and the scale, that mankind may observe right measure (establish themselves in justice):\n(HADID:25)\nReason, with its limitations, can be applied as a scale, but the Quran provides the clear guidance as to who are the true scale.\nVerily (indeed) it is Quran honourable,\nin a book, hidden,\nwhich none touches save the purified.\n(WAQI-AH: 77 to 79)\nThe touch, mentioned in the above verse, is not physical in nature, but is purely intellectual and spiritual, which implies total identification of the known, the knowing and the knower, inseparable from each other. Therefore, only the thoroughly purified souls, as shown in the above verse, can be in touch with the Quran in its pre-revealed form, as it is in the hidden book. The Quran clearly identifies such persons who have been thoroughly purified by Allah Himself to the perfect degree in verse 33 of al Ahzab. They are the Ahl ul Bayt, the people of the holy house. The well known and the most authentic declaration of the Holy Prophet (Hadith Thaqalayn) is the confirming interpretation of these verses. The holy book and the holy Ahl ul Bayt are inseparably identified with each other from their origin, down in the arc of descent, and up again in their ascent (return) to the presence of the maliki yawmid din. It makes no difference whether the term imamum mabin, in verse 12 of Ya Sin, is interpreted either as the Ahl ul Bayt or as the Quran, for these two are neither separate from each other nor will ever be separable, because one reflects the other.\nAnd everything we have confined into a clear expressive guide. (YA SIN:12)\nThe revealed book, in our hands, does not speak, and is therefore mute (samit); whereas the Ahl ul Bayt by being able to speak are eloquent (natiq). This conclusion is based upon the Quran and the wording of the Holy Prophet. Whoever does not accept it, does so, based on his own conjectural discretion. Whatever is said while explaining the verses of the Quran, throughout this commentary, is bas"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:3]\nYUMINUNA BIL GHAYB\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe literal meanings of iman, islam and din, used frequently in the Quran, are very close to each other. The submission of thoughts and feelings to the object of belief is iman. To surrender willingly, inwardly as well as outwardly, to the will (of a supreme being) is islam. A deeply rooted dutiful, devoted, submissive and abiding approach, by nature and in appearance, towards \"the approved discipline\" is din. Din has been used variously to mean judgement, subjugation, religion, to do good, to obey, to advance a loan, to take into account, to reward and to punish, but the root is that which has been stated above, which also implies all the given meanings.\nAccording to verses 14 and 15 of al Hujurat islam is the outward obedience and iman is the inward submission. Islam and iman become synonymous when islam is used with reference to inward submission and iman is used with reference to outward obedience. Let us examine the state of mind in connection with iman and din. All the mental tendencies and faculties together with their allied phenomenon is rooted in the human ego or the conscious-self, referred to as \"I\". The ego, endowed with self-consciousness, loves itself. This self-love is followed by the involvement and concern for self-protection, self-maintenance and self-advancement .\nSelf-love creates and promotes the emotions of devotion, hatred, lust, and anger, also feelings and imagination, thinking and contemplation. The love for self-preservation creates the lust (hunger) for food, which is responsible for the development of the sense of taste. It also enables to feel repulsion for that food which is harmful. This repulsion is termed as anger. The desire to preserve the self, in all times, through reproduction, is carried out by the sexual lust. It is because of self-love, that man loves that which belongs to him and to which he refers to as \"mine\" - parents, children, relatives, community and surroundings with which, in some way or the other, he is associated. Things which he feels as not his own or opposed to his interest, create repulsion in him. Man's activities are the expression of either the love or repulsion that he feels, whether or not the object of love or repulsion is within the control of his will power. With regard to those objects which are within the control of his will power, a lust for domination is developed. But if the object, loveable or repulsive, useful or harmful, is beyond his control, a sense of awe and reverence associated with the desire for an approach through surrender, submission and appeasement is developed, believing that the object is sacred. This submissive state of mind is described as din, and its expression takes the form of sacrifice (qurbani). In this sense din and iman are one and the same, i.e. the inclination of the mind and heart towards the object believed to be effective in one's destiny. Mere belief, or just to be sure of anything is not iman, but belief in its reality and its effectiveness in one's destiny, beyond the domination of one's own will power, is true iman. No one, not even those who pose as atheists, can be devoid of this subjective aspect of din and iman. The objective aspect or methods of approach bring in the differences. People may differ as to who or what should be held as sacred and how to pray and offer sacrifice, but no one can do without holding something or other as sacred and bowing down before that sacred object, and adopting a method of approach and adoration. The sacred objects and the methods of prayers and sacrifice have gone through an evolutionary process with the development of man's intellect, knowledge, experience, power of reasoning, contemplation, and, above all, on account of the instructions and guidance given by the divinely commissioned teachers.\nThe necessary consequence of religious tendency, natural in every man, as the result of self-love, is prayer and sacrifice. Sacrifice is an effort to break one's bonds so as to come in contact with the sacred being, the ultimate object of faith, by parting with some of his possessions, which, on account of his faith, are regarded as gifts received from the sacred being. Prayer is a demand put forward to the object of adoration and veneration; and when the demand is met, the bounties received are given to others, in charity, to please the fulfiller. So to take and to give, in religious adoration, go together. Only in how and what is given people are distinguished from each other. Din and iman, in the highest form, is yuminuna bil ghayb, a total and perfect inclination and commitment of the mind and the heart, on the strength of pure reasoning, to the unseen and the inconceivable reality, realised by all as beyond the grasp of human means and intellect. The loftier the object the more intense will be the faith in it. Although there are beings beyond the empirical knowledge like angels and jinn etc., yet they are created beings, definable and within the conceptual capacity of man; despite the fact that they cannot be verified through observation and experiment. Only Allah, beyond all definitions and limitations, is ghayb ul mutlaq, the incomprehensible absolute, the loftiest object of din and iman, the ultimate of iman bil ghayb, and not anything else created by Him. This iman bil ghayb is a dynamic force which takes man towards the absolute in a progressive and unfaltering stride. If any other unseen, except the ghayb ul mutlaq, is held as an object of faith, it will cause stoppage, obstruction and stagnancy, which results in idolatry. In verses 52 to 56 of al Anbiya this stagnancy has been condemned.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq says:\nThat which your mind, in its finest awareness, may distinctly grasp, would be your creation\nlike unto you, and that will bounce and come back to you.\nYUQIMUNAS SALAT\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe literal meaning of salat is the middle of the backbone. When used as a verb, it means the bending and unbending of the backbone. It is particularly employed when an animal is curved at the time of delivery. Figuratively, it was used for a bending posture at the time of giving or taking something. From this, it was adopted for prayer, to signify a submissive attitude. The Quran has drawn on this word to describe man's praying attitude towards Allah, as well as Allah's turning towards His creatures.\nThe natural religious tendency of man, as the result of self-love, makes him bend before the absolute, in prayer, to express his wants and needs in order to obtain fulfilment. The bending of the absolute means His turning towards the supplicant to give that which he deserves.\nAccording to verses 41 to 43 of al Ahzab, for the creature, prayer is the expression of his quest for the grace of the creator, and for the creator His salat is the bestowal of His grace upon the creature.\nIn Islam, the purpose of prayer is to please Allah, and nothing pleases Allah but that which is the most beneficial to His creatures. Therefore, no prayer is approved by Islam save that which has been prescribed by Allah, nothing less, nothing more, as man has no right to add, omit or alter the prescribed prayer.\nMIMMA RAZAQNAHUM YUNFIQUN\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nPlease refer to the commentary of yumununa bil ghayb about spending in the way of the Lord which is the essential property of iman. Spending in the way of Allah, as prescribed by Him pleases Him because it is a source of great benefit to His creatures.\nAs mentioned earlier, the giving away to others from that which has been provided is not confined to the material possessions, but it includes every thing which comes under the term provision, like knowledge etc.\n(see commentary for verse 1).\n(see commentary for verse 2)"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:4]\nThe pious are those who believe not only in the truthfulness of the Quran, revealed to the Holy Prophet, but also in the holy books sent down to the prophets of Allah before him. This makes Islam a universal religion for the whole mankind. According to verse 24 of Fatir, verse 78 of al Mumin, verse 150 of al Nisa, and verse 136 and 285 of al Baqarah, no other religion besides Islam, enjoins as an article of faith, the belief in the truthfulness of all the messengers of Allah and the holy scriptures.\nBIL AKHIRATI\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAkhirat literally means the end, but in the Quran this word has mostly been used in the sense of the hereafter, the life after death. In some places it means the world beyond the visible world.\nThey know (only) the appearance (the apparent phase) of the life of the world (the lower life), and are heedless (negligent) of the hereafter (its other phase).\n(RUM: 7)\nThe use of the word zahir (apparent), and ghafil (negligent) makes clear that akhirat referred to in the above-noted verse is an antonym of zahir, which is known to most people, yet they are negligent. The word negligence is justified when something is known but paid no attention. The life after death is not the antonym of the apparent, nor it is the neglected known. It is something to come. Therefore, in the above verse, the \"other phase\" means the world beyond the range of physical experience, which is the world of subjective insight and conscious self. In this connection, it must be noted that even the material world is not known to us through the physical experience of senses because they are affected by the qualities and conditions of the matter, not by the matter itself; and the conscious self is closer to the other world than to the lower world, which is more akin to the senses. For this reason ghafilun, not jahilun has been used. To know the true meaning, it is essential to take into consideration the context in which this word has been applied in the Quran.\nHere, in this verse akhirat has been utilised in the sense of hereafter, the life after death, or after\nthe end, the end of the material world. There is nothing without some end, in the sense of purpose, and the purpose lies beyond the \"apparent phase\", the world of awareness through the physical experience of the senses.\nHUM YUQINUN\nYaqin is the state of conviction and certainty acquired through an unshakeable evidence or proof. The description of muttaqin begins with iman bil ghayb, a complete submission of mind and heart to the ghaybul mutlaq and ends with yaqin, an unshakeable firm conviction and certainty that the ultimate purpose of life in this world lies in the life after death in the direction unto the absolute.\n(see commentary for verse 1)(see commentary for verse 3).\n(5) Essence, self or the nature of the inner being (Ma-idah : 108 - Qasas: 88 - Rahman: 27).\nHere it means total submission.\nMere verbal profession of faith does not bring salvation, as the Jews and the Christians thought, but guidance and its rewards are for him who submits himself entirely to Allah and acts in the way of Allah, in conformity with Allah's will, uncompromisingly, in full awareness of his goal, shedding all strings of attachments and desires. There is no fear for him, nor shall he grieve. At the time of migrating from Makka to Madina, the Holy Prophet had a companion with him. They took refuge in a cave to avoid the pursuing enemies. The companion was miserable with fear and grief. The Holy Prophet asked him not to fear because Allah was present with them. Also there were companions who deserted the Holy Prophet when the terror and fright of death made them flee from the battle of Uhad.\n(see commentary for verse 2) Belief in the revealed scriptures, as the true word of Allah, is one of the articles of faith (Baqarah: 285).\nHis reliance upon Allah's ability to protect whom He wills, was unqualified;\n    and, above all, being from one and the same divine light, they were so closely integrated that one had \nto be in the shoes of another all the time.\nWhile the assassins were lying in wait for the planned strike, they, on several occasions, looked slyly at the bed, and were assured by the blanket of the Holy Prophet that he was sleeping inside it. They did not realise that it was Ali under the blanket, whilst the Holy Prophet opened the door and walked away unnoticed. As planned, the assassins, naked swords in their hands, broke in and removed the blanket from the sleeper's face. They were surprised to find Ali there instead of the Holy Prophet. They viewed his composure and steady expression of resolute courage, and having failed to obtain any information about the whereabouts of the Holy Prophet, disappointed, they stepped out one by one.\nThe Holy Prophet had asked his companions not to leave their homes on the night of the migration, but he found Abu Bakr following him on his way to Madina. However, he allowed him to accompany him and they took refuge in a cave, because after finding Ali in the bed, the conspirators at once started the quest for the Holy Prophet. By Allah's will, a spider wove a web across the mouth of the cave, and in front of it a pigeon laid her eggs. Seeing this, the pursuers presumed that no one had entered the cave for a long time and did not search it. Inside the cave, the companion of the Holy Prophet was frightened and had started crying in anguish when he heard the voices of the enemy. The Holy Prophet recited the following verse to console him.\nDo not fear. Allah is with us. (Tawbah: 40) On the next morning, Ali returned to the depositors all that which they kept with the Holy Prophet in trust and left Makka, with the ladies of the house, to join the Holy Prophet in Madina. It must be noted that even his opponents called the Holy Prophet al-amin, the trustworthy, and kept their valuables in his custody. And it was Ali, the executor of his will, who discharged all his commitments on his behalf. But the Muslim ummah, after the departure of the Holy Prophet, went along with the frightened companion and forgot him whose unshakeable faith in Allah, love for His messenger, and matchless courage entitled him to obtain mardatillah, the pleasure and discretion of Allah. Ali's risking his life for the Holy Prophet pleased Allah so much that He revealed this verse in his honour, referring to Ali's actions as selling his soul for earning Allah's pleasure and permission.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:5]\nThe use of ula-ika, the demonstrative pronoun for remote things or persons, as the subject of the sentence implies \"those only\" (a restriction) who depend on and follow the guidance from their Lord, and are successful in their life-journey. The reason for this restriction is obvious, as, although His guidance is universal, but only people of such calibre (described as muttaqin), and none else, can avail and use the guidance, in its minutest detail, in letter and spirit, to the full satisfaction and pleasure of the guide.\n(see commentary for verse 1)(see commentary for verse 3)(see commentary for verse 4)(see commentary for verse 2) Those Jews and Christians who believe in some prophets and not in others (Nisa: 150) are, in fact, the real unbelievers (Nisa: 151 ).\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:6]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nKufr means to cover or to conceal. In the Quran covering the truth, or the fault, has been described as kufr. Covering or concealing the truth is turning the mind from it. Covering the fault is redeeming or redressing, or wiping it out, as per verse 31 of al Nisa. It is mostly used in a sense directly opposite to iman.\nIn the sense of concealment of truth, kufr is a wilful act, (may be) not out of ignorance, but due to ulterior motives or unreasonable bigotry. Therefore the disbelievers (kafirs), devoid of faith, do not follow guidance, whether they are warned or not. In view of verse 1 of al Furqan, it would be wrong to say that the Holy Prophet has been advised not to carry on his mission. It points out the obstinacy of the infidels and their expected reaction to the warnings, on account of their trend and tendency to suppress the truth.\nWhen this biased and prejudiced bent of mind, to reject the real and adopt the unreal, becomes a rigid habit, \"sealing\" of hearts takes place, according to the next verse.\n(see commentary for verse 1)(see commentary for verse 3)(see commentary for verse 4)(see commentary for verse 2) \"Nor shall you attain unto righteousness until you spend of that which you love\", says verse 92 of Ali Imran.\nIslam does not demand indifference to worldly possessions but makes it obligatory to subordinate the love of possession to the spirit of giving it away in the name and cause of Allah, the real owner of the bounties, which are given to some of His servants as a favour. They should hold these bounties as a trust to be distributed according to His command. Emancipation of the captives or liberation of slaves is an essential condition of the genuine faith in Allah.\nOf all the religions, only Islam condemns slavery. It treats liquidation of the institution of slavery as a prime virtue. In verse 13 of al Balad freeing a slave has been highly praised. In verse 89 of al Ma-idah and in verse 3 of al Mujadalah the liberation of slaves has been prescribed as kaffarah (expiation).\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"For the love of Allah give away your wealth for freeing those enemies whom you have captured in war.\"\nOnce the Holy Prophet gave a slave to Abu Dhar with instructions to treat him kindly and to do with him as he would with himself. As soon as Abu Dhar brought the slave home, he set him free. \"Allah will bless you\", said the Holy Prophet when he heard the news.\n"

Lack of proper use of the faculties of discernment and understanding blunts their judgement and reasonableness, a logical penalty, referred to in verse 179 of al Araf, and verse 5 of Ha Mim, wherein they themselves bear witness to the penalty they had been inflicted with. According to the commentator of Majma ul Bayan, seal means witness or testimony.\nAllah bears witness to the loss of usefulness of the disbelievers' faculties to see, hear and understand,\nin order to inform the Holy Prophet that all attempts, howsoever sincere and eager, will fail to bring them back to the right path, as they are unable to pay attention to any type of warning.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAs has been explained on page 24, in the commentary of verse 5 of al Fatihah, man's action is in fact a reaction to Allah's action which becomes active in response to the complex of essential qualities of the object which reacts.\nQULUB\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nQalb (heart) in the Quran, refers to the functions of the conscious self. It is the centre of total human consciousness, known as \"I\", like the physical heart which is the centre of the blood circulation system. The mind receives information ; through the experiences of the senses, which are developed into ideas by a mental operation, which also perceives feelings. These feelings are translated into actions, and the actions return back to the mind, undergoing the same process. It resembles the circular movement of the blood into the physical heart. Another justification is the close relation of the feelings with the physical heart, the main organ of the body, which, moved by the feeling, acts. The qalb reacts to the suggestions and guidance received through the experiences of the senses as well as subjective insight, corresponding to the individual peculiarities. Some qalbs are more receptive to goodness, refined thoughts and feelings of a higher spiritual nature. Some qalbs are more inclined towards evil and worldly pleasures. A \"one and the same\" suggestion may cause different reactions in the two directly opposite qalbs. One qalb receives the divine command and carries it out, while the other rejects it and revolts.\nThe immediate organ between the heart and the divine preaching is the ear, therefore, it has been connected with the heart, and as the result of the sealing of the heart, the ear has also been sealed. Consequently the disbelievers' vision has been obscured. Now they cannot see the truth. For them is a painful torture in the hereafter.\n(see commentary for verse 1)(see commentary for verse 3)(see commentary for verse 4)(see commentary for verse 2)"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:8]\nFrom verse 8 to verse 20 the conduct of the hypocrites has been described.\nAqa Mahdi Puya Says:\nThose disbelievers, who put on a show of coming into the fold of Islam in order to avail safety and security, to serve their self-interest, and to protect their social position, have been described as the hypocrites (munafiqin).\nAlthough a large number of commentators find it suitable to point to Abdullah bin Obay and his comrades, exclusively, as the hypocrites referred to here and in other places, but the use of the word munafiqin is not restricted to Madani surahs. In verse 11 of al Ankabut, revealed in Makka, when Abdullah bin Obay and his active partisans did not appear on the scene, this word was used to identify, in general, one and all, in any age, who may possess this evil.\nAmong those who accepted Islam and agreed to follow the teachings of the Holy Prophet, some were reluctant converts; some were uncertain about the bonafides of the Holy Prophet as the messenger of Allah; some, under protest and with a heavy heart, followed the mainstream but at heart were pagans; some only put up a front. Such half-hearted, unwilling, or deceptive acceptance of faith is devoid of the higher spiritual conceptions, therefore, sincere and perfect practice of the faith was not possible. And men and women belonging to this category could never fulfil any of the demands of the faith, particularly that which did not serve their interest, because, in their minds, something else, not the faith in Allah and the Holy Prophet, was more likely and feasible. The incident about the cutting down of trees during the siege of Bani Nadhir, referred to in verse 5 of al Hashr; the abandonment in time of trouble by running away from the battle of Uhad, referred to in verses 153 to 155 of Ali Imran; the expression of doubt about the bonafides of the messenger of Allah, throws light on the conduct of those companions who were weak or indecisive in their belief.\nIn between the two directly opposite groups, the thoroughly purified muttaqin and the munafiqin whose hearts, ears and eyes have been sealed, there is the type of above-noted group of converts who agreed to give answer to the call of the Holy Prophet to worship one Allah and follow His commandments, but on account of their inability to detach themselves completely from the habits, customs and mental attitude of the \"days of ignorance\" and infidelity, failed, on many occasions, to meet the demands of pure faith,\nbecause of the infiltration of doubts and suspicions about the genuineness of the prophethood of the\nHoly Prophet.\n(i) According to Tabari (Vol. 3, page 21, published from Egypt), Shibli (Al Faruq), Ibna Kathir (Badayah Wan Nahayah: Volume 4, page 28, published in 1351 Hijra from Egypt), the second and the third caliphs were among the deserters in the battle of Uhad.\n(ii) According to Tarikh Khamis, Vol. 2, page 24, published in 1302 Hijra from Egypt), Sahih Bukhari (Vol. 2; page 82 published in 1355 Hijra from Egypt), Tafsir Durr Manthur (Vol.2; page 77 published in 1314 Hijra from Egypt), and Tafsir Kathir (Vol. 3; page 351 published in 1402 from Beirut), the second caliph Hazrat Umar bin Khattab, as per his own version, had never before suspected so strongly the bonafides of Muhammad the true messenger of Allah, as at the time of the treaty of Hudaybiya.\nThere are different classes of believers. No doubt the types described above are not hypocrites, but, as pure and perfect faith is a very refined state of mind and heart, they cannot be counted in the highest category of believers. It is very difficult for an individual to know the degree of his own faith (verse 9 refers to the self-delusion of such believers), until he comes across a test and trial. The true quality of the faith of the confused companions was laid bare whenever tested, yet such indecisive believers, after the Holy Prophet, were acclaimed as the heroes of Islam.\nMany a commentator wrongly refers to Abdullah bin Obay and his associates whenever munafiqin are discussed in the Quran, as a scapegoat substitute for the really dangerous hypocrites whose subversive activities proved more harmful to Islam than Abdullah bin Obay and his comrades. It is an attempt to restrict the general view of the Quran. In fact Abdullah bin Obay's activities never amounted to a real threat. He had no influence even over his own family. He was a very wealthy man, and therefore, wanted to be the chief of Madina, but his chances of success disappeared after the arrival of the Holy Prophet. He was a man of no importance. Had his schemes been really harmful to Islam, the Holy Prophet would not have led his funeral prayers.\nThe verses in the Quran, about the hypocritical attitude of some of the disciples of the Holy Prophet, are more applicable to the people of Quraysh than any other group. The aim of the Quran is to describe the psychological condition of the companions surrounding the Holy Prophet, in order to classify the reaction of mankind, in general, till eternity, to the final message of Allah, conveyed through the last prophet. The reaction to the divine message divides people in different groups. Those whose commitment is total on account of their complete concord with the prophetic guidance, occupy the highest position nearest to Allah. Those who are not fully convinced, due to lack of wisdom, may not oppose and go astray, but only manage to keep themselves from denying the faith.\nApart from these two groups, there are some who openly oppose Allah and his prophet, with no hope of any improvement in their attitude.\nThere is another class of people who profess the faith in a hypocritical manner, with a rigid antagonistic attitude of mind and heart. They are those whose heart, hearing and sight have not yet been sealed. There is a hope of improvement if they come out of their wavering. They come under the definition of munafiqin until the improvement takes place. This wavering in most of the disciples of the Holy Prophet was due to their attachment with the old habits, customs and creeds. The force of the new mission tried to detach them from their \"days of ignorance\" psyche. This conflict between the tendency of the \"days of ignorance\" and the irresistible energy of truth created the mental conflict which was responsible for their activities both during and after the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. This wavering has been pointed out by the Quran in verses 144 and 149 of Ali Imran, and verses 25 and 26 of Muhammad. There are many authentic traditions that the Holy Prophet also expressed his concern about this \"turning back\" of his companions. It must be noted that though the Quran deals with the hypocrites in many surahs in various shades and descriptions, but the Muslim historians, however, do not mention the far reaching influence of the policies and activities carried out by the hypocrites, as rulers, after the departure of the Holy Prophet. On the contrary, a general view is presented that every one of the companions was a true faithful, a bright star, and a symbol of guidance, in total disregard to the indisputable role of the hypocrites during and after the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. They did not die before the Holy Prophet. They emerged with full force after him and exercised full control over the destiny of the ummah.\nThe Holy Prophet says:\nA hypocrite is he who lies, breaks promises, and proves himself dishonest if trusted.\nIn fact there were very few among the companions who, detached from their old habits, customs and creeds, submitted wholeheartedly to the religion of Allah.\nThe Holy Quran says:\nVery few of My servants are grateful.\n(SABA:13)\nIn verses 8 to 20 reference is made to those hypocrites whose conscience, hearing and sight have been sealed and there is no possibility of their return to the truth.\nVerse 9 confirms the position of the people, described and discussed in the previous verse, who are under the delusion that their state of mind is hidden from Allah. To obtain wealth and power they try to attract the attention of the people by putting on a superficial show of virtuousness. They may win the goodwill of the common people but their expectation of getting a reward from Allah ends in frustration, because He is fully aware of the intentions of His creatures.\nHe does not take them out of their delusion. Hypocrisy lurks in the hearts of those who are not thoroughly purified. Circumstances and lure of worldly gains, and not independent conviction, motivated many an early convert to come into the camp of the Holy Prophet. When, the doings and sayings of the messenger of Allah, under the strict commands of Allah, began to make clear that authority to guide and administer the society belonged to the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, the thoroughly purified, as the fulfilment of the divine will according to the verse 33 of al Ahzab, their envy and grudge against the Holy Prophet and his holy Ahl ul Bayt came into the open. In the light of verse 80 of al Nisa whosoever opposes and subverts the authority of the Holy Prophet, in fact disobeys Allah.\nThe Quran says:\nVerily, those who cause suffering to Allah and His messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and the hereafter, and He has prepared for them a disgraceful punishment.\n(AHZAB:57)\nThe Holy Prophet says:\nFatima is my flesh and blood. Whosoever causes suffering to her in fact causes suffering to me. He who has pained me in fact has pained Allah; and indeed, he is a disbeliever.\n(Sahih Bukhari: Vol. 2; page 206 published in 1355 Hijra from Egypt, Sahih Muslim: Vol. 4; page 125 published in 1349 Hijra from Egypt).\nMany books of history and traditions clearly mention the disgraceful attitude of the companions towards the dearest daughter of the Holy Prophet, after his death. For example in Vol. 1, page 64 of Tarikh Abul Fida, published from Egypt, it is written that the two caliphs were among those who went to the house of Fatima for setting it on fire. Also Abi Fat-ha Shahrastani in Al Milal Wan Nahal on page 25 and 26 mentions the events which took place at the house of Bibi Fatimah.\nAnfusahum means themselves as well as their associates. \"And they do not perceive\" represent the men who imagine themselves to be good and those who follow such men. In fact they do not know what they are. They are actually self-deluded. This is the state of mind of all those who are misguided and misled by their own false judgement.\nTo follow the true guidance, communicated through the word of Allah, it is essential not only to know those upon whom, on account of their knowledge and total commitment to the divine guidance, bounties had been bestowed, but also to identify those who defied it and went astray, in order to avoid following their wickedness.\nThe policy to verbally profess faith in Allah and His messenger, so as to deceive the faithful, in the hope of getting material gains, is termed in verse 10, and in many other verses as the \"disease of the heart\", the result of which may be disbelief (kufr), or hypocrisy (nifaq). Envy and jealousy took hold of those who did not sincerely believe in the supreme authority of the Holy Prophet. The disbelief, the envy and the jealousy of the hypocrites has been termed as a disease. Since it is Allah who bestowed the supreme authority on the Holy Prophet, therefore, the envy and jealousy in the hearts of the hypocrites, as a disease, which increased proportionately to the enhancement in the glory of the Holy Prophet, is the result of Allah's will.\nThe duplicity in the conduct of the hypocrites, pointed out in verse 11, was a mutual arrangement between them and the infidels to check and upset the growing honour and status of the Holy Prophet and the dominance of Islam, through intrigue and subversion; but, to pacify the questioning of the believers, they said it was to bring the infidels to friendly terms with the Muslims, whereas, truly, they were planning to usurp the political power in order to lay hands on the material gains which would be there to possess after the departure of the Holy Prophet. It became plain to them that during the lifetime of the messenger of Allah such schemes could not be implemented, therefore, the enemies of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, in the garb of peace-makers, played a waiting game. It must be noted that though, after the Holy Prophet, they took the control of the government, but earned the displeasure of almighty Allah who has promised painful punishment on the liars, a fact which they did not perceive.\nFor ordinary people it is very difficult to detach themselves from the clutches of old ideologies which serve their selfish interest, and follow or believe in a new faith, free from the lure of profit or the fear of loss, particularly when the new faith demands a complete rejection of the viciousness of the animal self which clings to raw passions and crude urges. They were proud of their social position and possessions under the old system. This misconceived individual and group pride made the infidels look down upon the true believers (with really awakened minds) as inferiors, because they (the infidels) could not use reason or put forward arguments to contradict the true faith, Islam. Verse 13 makes it clear that, in truth, it is they who are mean and stupid, not those who believe in Allah and His messenger by discarding false notions of pride and conceit\nAs you sow so shall you reap. It is the law of nature. In verse 14 and 15 \"the making fun\" of the believers by the infidels has been compared to deviltry, but the paying back in the same coin by Allah is the scorn (or the last laugh) they shall experience on the day of judgement in the form of eternal punishment. In this world they have been given (enough) rope, pelf and power, to hang themselves in the end.\nIn verse 16 the wilful adoption of error has been likened to a bad bargain.\nBelieving in the truth, according to verse 17, is like the illumination of a fire which lights up the surrounding. The spark of faith which had just been kindled could have been turned into a bright floodlight but evils like envy, malice and love of material possessions put out the spark of faith, therefore, Allah, in view of the prevalent evil, took away the light of faith and abandoned them to the utter darkness of ignorance and disbelief.\nIn verse 18 the loss of the \"inner light\" is illustrated as becoming deaf, dumb and blind, due to which there is no possibility of finding the way leading to the truth.\nRain makes the earth grow life-giving and life-preserving provisions. In verse 19, Islam has been compared to an abundant rain. The lightning is the victories Islam won against the forces of infidelity.\nThe darkness is the occasion when the Muslims did not have an upper hand, which created doubts in the minds of the hypocrites about the genuineness of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet. They feared total annihilation. In verse 20, it is said that the hypocrites, attracted momentarily by the glory of Islam, rejoiced at their joining the ranks of the Muslims; and in the hour of trials and tribulations they recoiled, scared and doubled-minded. They were under the total control of Allah's power. There is no escape from His hold. In the days of early Islam it was in the interest of the Muslims to let the hypocrites remain in delusion.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe new mission, Islam, is like a heavy shower coming down from heaven, a promising event every one welcomes, but the thunder, lightning and darkness, coming along with it, create fright and make people take precaution against the impending threat. In the days of early Islam some people anticipated re"

For him the life of this world is a burden of responsibilities. He is not afraid to lose it in the way of Allah, on the contrary he readily accepts death, and is fearless and devoted. In verse 119 of al Barat Allah asks those who believe to remain attached with the truthful ones whose qualities have been described in this verse-\"these are the ones who are the truthful ones\"; also refer to verse 15 of al Hujurat. Such superb qualities, in perfection and completeness, are found only in the Holy Prophet and his holy Ahl ul Bayt, if the history of Islam is carefully studied without prejudice .\nIf verse 2 of this surah is read in the light of this verse it becomes clear that the Quran is a guidance to the pious who possess all the qualities mentioned in this verse - they are the Holy Prophet and the twelve holy Imams in whom each quality is manifest in its highest perfection and completeness. They are those who have been chosen by Allah to guide mankind towards the path of Allah through the Quran. Therefore, Shias, after the Holy Prophet, follow only Ali and the holy Imams as their guides because of their unique merits, acknowledged even by their enemies. The whole Muslim world, without exception, knows and accepts the fact that it was Ali alone who earned the unique title of mazhar ul aja-ib - the manifestation of (divine) wonders, because Ali and the Holy Prophet are the manifestations of one and the same divine light.\nThose who do not sell their souls to Allah tremble, fear and lose heart and confidence whenever they encounter distress or misfortune, because their profession of the faith in Allah is pretentious, sly and artful, not real.\nTo know the true significance of this verse, it is sufficient to quote the saying of the Holy Prophet that whoever acts upon this (one) verse attains perfection in faith.\n"

In Islam there is no merit in any virtue imposed by force. Willing service to the Lord, in the spirit of thankfulness, is a must for the creature, in return for the countless gifts, favours and bounties He bestows on His creatures. Imam Ali ibna abi Talib defines obedience (service) as under:\n(1) The service offered out of fear is the obedience of a slave.\n(2) The service offered for gain is the obedience of a businessman or trader.\n(3) The service offered by a free man, of his own choice, in thankfulness for the bounties he receives from the beneficent Lord, is the obedience of a sincere faithful who obeys on account of his independent conscience.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nObedience is to react to the order of authority in complete agreement and unity of feeling.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:23]\nIn this verse the almighty all-wise Allah throws an open challenge to mankind for making an effort to compose even one surah in the style and manner of the Quran, not only to assert the genuineness of the divine words revealed to a man who did not receive any type of education from any mortal, but also to put an end to doubts and speculations, for ever, that it could be the fabrication of any human mind.\nThis challenge refers to the Quran as a work of literature and wisdom, and not to its effects as some commentators wrongly try to prove. The inimitable literary excellence and the pure and perfect wisdom of the Quran has been and will always be beyond the reach of the literary and intellectual genius of mankind.\nSay (O Muhammad); If men and jinn should unite to produce the like of this Quran they could not produce the like of it though they were helpers one of another.\n(BANI ISRAIL: 88)\nAlso refer to Yunus: 38, Hud: 13.\nEven if any one makes an effort, there will be no witness available to testify to his claim. No attempt has been made so far, and no one shall succeed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nSince the beginning of Islam till today, the enemies of Islam have been trying to belittle Islam but they never dared to answer the challenge, in spite of repeated attempts made by the most celebrated scholars and men of letters, jointly and severally.\nIn what respect is the Quran an unchallengable miracle? How is it the proof of its own truthfulness? Several views have been put forward by both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars.\n(1) Eloquence and rhetorical excellence.\n(2) Prophecies.\n(3) Precepts and laws.\n(4) Effect of its forceful and fascinating tone on the human mind and heart.\nNo attempt has been made to look into the book itself to know why and in what sense it is a miracle. The book is the book of guidance. The duty of the messenger of Allah was to convey and preach guidance to mankind. The speaker or author arranges his words and sentences to make his ideas meaningful to the audience or the readers. In search of the best way to communicate the ideas, the science of grammar and the art of rhetoric had been developed. The use of language and style has to be adopted in relation to the class of people who are addressed. A message or guidance of universal nature, dealing with all aspects of human life in its manifold dimensions (individual and social, economic and political, physical and spiritual) not for any particular person or class but for every human being, community and nation, educated and uneducated, till eternity, must be the work of a person who knows, inside out, human nature in general as well as the capacity to understand and the tendencies of different individuals and communities of different classes and races. In addition, the relation of each individual to the other, the relation of mankind as a whole to other beings and surrounding nature, the beginning and the end of human life, the first and the final cause of creation of which man is a part, have to be taken into consideration. The style and substance of such a message should not only appeal to the \"welfare-oriented\" interests of the people but also should be able to refine human feelings and emotions. Such a power of expression is beyond the limit of human ability.

The faith in Allah as the creator and the law-giver, and the belief in the hereafter wherein every individual will be rewarded in proportion to his obedience, or will be punished because of his disobedience to the divine law, are the two essential principles of Islam. It is downright dishonesty to interpret the fire as the miseries, torments, discomforts and calamities of the life in this world. This attribution of giving fanciful meanings, unsupported by the Quran or the sayings of the Holy Prophet, betrays the materialistic bias of such interpreters who do not agree that there is a real existence beyond this world.\nThe view expressed by the Ahmadi school in connection with verses 23 and 24, are in fact .the reproduction of the ideas put forward by Mirza Abul Fazl Gulpaygani, the leader of Baha-i movement.

The emphasis on the continuance of consciousness by Islam is to make man guard against evil. The theory of Karma (transmigration), advanced by the Vedantic school, states that man loses the consciousness and memory of the experiences of his previous life as soon as he dies and takes another form of life. This theory is of no use to man as it does not stimulate him to do good or avoid evildoing.\nIn giving the description of the life of the hereafter, the Quran refers to the pain and pleasure experienced by the senses, because there is no other way to make man form an idea about the pains and pleasures, as a punishment or a reward, awaiting him in his other life, which he earns through bad or good conduct in this life. In the absence of the developed senses, to have an idea of the actual pains and the pleasures of the life of the hereafter, a figurative form has to be used to reach man in general, an example of which is verse 15 of Muhammad. The intellectual significance of the parables presented to man cannot be grasped by the common people save those endowed with wisdom. The Quran says that the life of the hereafter is the developed continuation of the life of the world. Not losing the essential elements, this life takes to a highly refined form in the next life, more real, effective and purposeful. Every object of our senses has a corresponding existence in the heaven. The social life of the hereafter, with positive and negative forces, is another fact which Quran makes known to us.\nThe rewards, mentioned in this verse, are obtainable through a creative power bestowed upon the faithful who win the pleasure of Allah by doing good and avoiding evil, in love of the creator. Azwaj means spouses, husbands or wives.

The second or the manifest covenant is that which an individual agrees to be bound by when he or she embraces Islam, which, in fact, is a surrender of the self to the will of Allah.\nThe covenant referred to here is that by which the believers bound themselves before Allah through\nthe Holy Prophet at Ghadir Khum when the verse 67 of al Ma-idah was revealed. Every believer accepted the declaration of the messenger of Allah that of whomsoever the Holy Prophet was the lord-master, Ali son of Abu Talib was also his lord-master. After the unanimous undertaking of the believers, the following verse was revealed.\nThis day I have perfected for you, your religion, and have completed My favour on you, and chosen for you Islam (to be) the religion.\nTherefore, fulfilment of the covenant made with Allah is demanded in verses 20, 21 and 25 of al Rad, so that after the departure of the Holy Prophet, the believers might not follow any other person save Ali ibna abi Talib, who alone was declared worthy and able to carry out the mission of Islam, as the lawful authority (lord-master), in the absence of the Holy Prophet.\nThe declaration was not a mere fancy of the Holy Prophet to honour Ali, but in compliance with Allah's command to save the followers of Islam from yielding to those who make mischief in the earth and spread corruption in the garb of religious leaders. According to verse 217 of al Baqarah, mischief is more grievous than carnage. Islam stands for peace and harmony. And when is peace disturbed? Only when anyone wants to have (usurp) something which rightfully is not his.\nIslam has prescribed a well-knit structure of human relationship to maintain peace and harmony in the society. In addition to various aspects of human relations, Allah has, with a purpose in view, made it obligatory for the believers to know and adhere to the relationship prescribed between them and the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt. To avoid the overwhelming delusions of falsehood it is essential to accept the authority of the Holy Prophet, Ali ibna abi Talib, and the divinely commissioned rightly guided guides, in his progeny.\nThis verse applies to everyone who opposes the divinely established authority of imamat (the guidance through the holy Imams) immediately succeeding the risalat (the prophethood of the Holy Prophet) which is the covenant every faithful adherent of Islam has to make good.\n(see commentary for verse 4)(see commentary for verse 2)"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:30]\nTo understand this verse the following explanations should be carefully studied:\nANGELS\nAngels, according to the Quran, are finite creatures, devoid of substance, in the sense of matter, therefore, imperceptible by our senses.\nAn Ahmadi commentator describes the angels as energy without any freedom of will and consciousness, which proves untrue in view of the reply the angels gave to Allah's declaration about His will to send a khalifa on the earth. It means that the angels have been endowed with freedom of will to give expression to their views whenever they choose to do so, and that they are liable to err, because Allah told them that they did not know what Allah knew when they made known their opinion.\nIn whatever manner created and wherever found, the angels, finite creatures of light, endowed with consciousness and intelligence, act to fulfil the divine plan. They take any physical form (except pigs, dogs and other base animals) to become visible to human vision, but belong to the celestial realm.\nJINN\nJinn are also conscious beings. Angels are made of light, therefore, on account of their illuminating gracious nature only good comes out from them. Jinn are made of fire, therefore, more often than not, evil is associated with them. They can also take any physical form, including debased animals. The word mala-ik is derived from the Arabic malk, not from the Hebrew root alaka. The meaning of malk, mulk, milk and malakut is possession, which is also ownership or holding. The holding authority is malik or maalik or malak, who is also the owner or the sovereign, exclusively used by the Quran to refer to Allah. The whole universe is milk or mulk and the holder is the absolute owner, Allah. Between the absolute owner and the held mulk there are dominions over which the intermediary authorities exercise control, with Allah's consent, in relation to the dominion above them. Each of these dominions is termed as malakut and each holding authority is called malak. The pagans worship these mala-ik, under misconceived conclusion, as the independent authorities, either the sons or the daughters of the absolute authority, who can speak or advocate on their behalf to the king of kings. It is because they do not have the insight, or true guidance, to view the spiritual world, as pointed out by verses 26 to 31 of al Najm.\nAllah alone holds the authority. No interceding authority shall be accepted by Him, save those to whom He Himself has delegated the authority, according to verse 87 of Maryam and such other verses in the Quran.\nTherefore worship of no one is acceptable, in Islam, save the worship of Allah.\nKHALIFA\nThe literal meaning of khalaf is to come after, follow, succeed etcetera. In this verse it has been used in the sense of succeeding, in fact, representing Allah on the earth, to exercise His authority in terms of \"reacting\" to His will, as His vicegerent. This is the basis of prophethood. Some schools of thought hold the view that reason and intellect, at the disposal of man, are enough to represent Allah, and there is no need of the delegation of authority. In this verse however the necessity of a vicegerent of Allah on the earth has been conclusively proved, appointment of whom cannot and shall not be made by any one save Allah. Khalifatullah, the representative of Allah, is he whom Allah Himself delegates His authority.\nThese are they whom We gave the book and the authority and the prophethood;\nThese are they whom Allah has guided, so, follow their guidance;\n(AN-AM 89 and 90)\nNeither the consensus of public opinion, nor a group, nor an individual has the right to represent the will of Allah. Even the prophets or the angels did not have the right to say anything in the matter of appointment of the khalifa. Allah does not allow any one to interfere with the execution of His will, nor can any one question Him. Here and in many other places, dealing with the delegation of authority, it has been asserted that His will and choice is not arbitrary but is always based on the recognition of merit. Adam was appointed as His vicegerent, in preference to the angels, on the merit of possessing the knowledge which they did not have. According to verse 124 of al Baqarah Allah appointed prophet Ibrahim as the Imam after He had tried Ibrahim with a number of things which he fulfilled, with the clear provision that although there would be Imams in his progeny, but those who were unjust would not receive this authority. In verse 947 of al Baqarah, Saul is appointed as an authority over the people because of his wisdom and strength, in preference to those who claimed to be more worthy than him on account of their worldly position. In verses 17 to 25 of al Sad, Allah appoints Dawud as His vicegerent on the merit of wisdom, power of judgement and obedience to Allah's will.\nThe most important qualifications, mentioned in the Quran, are given below:\n(i) Untiring and continuous remembrance of Allah, with no drift or diversion under any type\nof circumstance.\n(ii) Never giving in to the demands motivated by self-oriented interests.\n    Following only the divine revelations.\n    Being the first and the foremost in establishing and carrying out every virtue to the point of perfection.\n(v) Awareness and wisdom of all laws (physical and moral) made by Allah, and their operation, so as not to make any mistakes; and for this awareness received no guidance or education from any one save Allah.\n(vi) No type of adversity, crisis or temptation should affect the tranquillity of the mind and the heart, described as sakinah in the Quran.\n(vii) The purity of birth, character and conduct because of which they are the most honoured with Allah (Hujurat:13), the foremost in faith and virtue, in receiving the rewards, and in their nearness to Allah (Waqi-ah:10,11).\n(viii) Ruling over the people with justice as pointed out in verse 26 of al Sad.\nKeeping in view the above-noted qualities, Allah, in verses 33 and 34 of Ali Imran, says that He had, on account of certain basic qualities, chosen Adam, Nuh, the descendants of Ibrahim and Imran and the Holy Prophet, the descendant of Ibrahim through Isma-il. The Quran does not advocate hereditary rights of succession but asserts that this lineage had a distinctive divine peculiarity for which they had been chosen as vicegerents of Allah. The reason for bestowing this privilege on the descendants of Ibrahim is known to Allah only, because as said by Allah in the event of appointing Adam as khalifa, He knows that which His creatures do not know. We must accept the limitations of our knowledge and glorify the grace and justice of Allah.\nWe have given to Ibrahim's children the book and the wisdom and We gave them a great kingdom.\n(NISA: 54)\nThe above-noted verse refers to the Holy Prophet as the last prophet in the lineage of prophet Ibrahim.\nThe vicegerency of Allah did not come to an end after the Holy Prophet. It continued. In verse 77 of Bani Israil the almighty Allah says:\nThis was Our way with Our messengers whom We had sent before you, and you shall not find\nany change in our way.\nSo it is confirmed that there is no change or modification in the principle and the method of appointing His vicegerent. In verse 55 of al Nur it is further made clear that the vicegerency continues after the Holy Prophet in the same way and manner as was in vogue before him. According to verses 31 and 32 of Fatir the holy book, in completed form, was given in inheritance to those servants of Allah whom He had selected. They belong to the children of Ibrahim excluding those who were zalimin, unjust, meaning those who, at any time in their lives, had worshipped a ghayr-allah (other than Allah). A careful study of \"the essentials for the readers of the Quran\", page 1 to 7, and the commentary of verse 2 of this surah makes it clear that Ali ibna abi Talib was the true vicegerent of Allah, appointed by Allah and His Holy Prophet.\nThe Holy Prophet was the perfector of Adam's mission of khalifatullah on the earth and the executor of the final will of the Lord of the worlds. Therefore his khalifa was also chosen and appointed by Allah to carry out the responsibilities of the divine office. The choice was not left to the fancy of the people, nor was any consultation needed. Inni ja-ilun fil ardi khalifah is an open declaration of His will and decision. Likewise the successor of the Holy Prophet could neither be chosen by the companions nor by the Holy Prophet himself. From the \"feast of the near relations\" to the event of \"Ghadir Khum\", narrated in detail on page 6 on the authority of well-known Muslim scholars, it was the will and command of Allah which the Holy Prophet had carried out.\nHistory also testifies to the fact that on all occasions, it was Ali who came forward to meet the challenge, and proved his qualities for the entitlement to the divine office of vicegerency, although all the companions had equal opportunities to rise to the occasion.\nAfter the conclusion and the termination of the office of prophethood, the infinite mercy of the merciful Lord did not leave mankind to go astray, misled by false leaders who usurped temporal authority, but commanded the Holy Prophet to declare the vicegerency of Ali and his progeny (the twelve Imams). The Holy Prophet, therefore, appointed Ali ibna abi Talib as his and Allah's khalifa on the earth.\nNow the people have the freedom of choice either to follow the divinely chosen Imams or run after the self-appointed false leaders.\nVerily, We have shown him (man) the (right) way, be he thankful (and follow it), or be ungrateful (reject it).\n(DAHR: 3)\nIn addition to that which has been stated on pages 1 to 7 there are countless merits and qualifications of Ali ibna abi Talib, mentioned and discussed on the authority of well-known Muslim scholars, in several publications like \"The Right Path\", \"Peshawar Nights\" and other books which can be studied to know the truth. It is not possible to refer to all these here. In the commentary of other verses of the Quran, his merits have been mentioned and discussed. They also give conclusive answers to the point of view of those who say that after the Holy Prophet, the authority for the application of divine legislation has been delegated by Allah to the faithful followers of Islam in general, therefore, every Muslim is the vicegerent of Allah, to exercise His authority according to the book and the sunnah of the Holy Prophet. The reference to the book of Allah and the sunnah (doings and sayings) of the Holy Prophet, for the sake of justifying their conduct after the Holy Prophet, appears self-defeating and contradictory, when these two agencies (they purport to follow), as explained above and at many suitable occasions in this book, have irrefutably established the vicegerency of Ali and his progeny, which only the followers of \"Muhammad and Ali Muhammad\" faithfully accept and follow.\nADAM\nWhile talking about the creation of Adam the appearance of visible form (matter) in the \"arc of ascent\" must be reviewed. Matter, in its primitive mode of being, carries the potentiality to develop into various forms - minerals, vegetables, animals and human beings. The capability of matter to give form to different species is determined by the \"unlike in nature\" potency of its elements or components. Earth, a product of matter, carried the capacity to bring some of its elements to a more advanced and highly organised body of a human being. Likewise its other components could develop other animate or inanimate objects. In form and substance each individual human being differs from the other. It is on account of the diversity in the potentiality of the components of the matter.\nThe development in the \"arc of ascent\" was gradual. The graduality (in time) is motion. Motion is the transfer of potentiality into actuality.\nWhile, indeed, He created you through regular stages,\nAnd Allah has caused you to grow as a growth from the earth,\n(NUH: 14 and 17)\nAccording to the following verses of the Quran man is made of the finest essence of the matter.\nVerily, We created man of wet clay of black mud moulded into shape,\n(HIJR: 26)\nAnd indeed We created man from an extract of clay,\n(MUMINUN: 1 2)\nThe distinctive aspects of each of the beings in the \"arc of ascent\" are reflections of the corresponding beings in the \"arc of descent\". Those angels who administer the development of the animal life belong to a higher order compared to those angels who control the development of the plant life. The human spirit (ruh) is the reflection emanated directly from the absolute (min ruhi), according to verse 29 of al Hijr. It does not mean separation because the absolute is indivisible. It refers to His direct attention or command. The other beings in the \"arc of ascent\" are also the reflections of His attention or command but through angelic medium.\nTinat (nature or disposition) is the extract of the total skill or worth in the matter under Allah's direct attention. The spirit, also referred to as \"I\", is the reflection of the divine command or attention referred to as min ruhi- My spirit, by Allah, but conditioned by its tinat. Ruh may be one but the reflections may be many and may differ in reflecting that which they have received. The total energy in the \"arc of descent\" conditions the tinat in its primitive stage, after which its developed state reflects the divine spirit. These two factors ruh and tinat constitute the creation of man. Through this evolutionary movement, from the\npotential state to the actual form, as the Quran says, man in particular and all other species in general, have been developed from their respective origins which carry their respective potentialities.\nRuh, according to the Quran and the Holy Prophet's sayings refers to that which proceeds from the absolute through the \"arc of descent\". The nafs (soul, ego or self) is the corresponding reflection or the reaction in the \"arc of ascent\". As this reflection is conditioned by the tinat, it cannot have any existence prior to the development of the tinat. On the contrary, the ruh or the corresponding action in the arc of descent has its existence prior to the reflection in the arc of ascent. If the reference is to the radiation or the acting source in the \"arc of descent\", it exists before the body, and is eternal with the eternity of the source. If the reference is made to the reflection (human ego, or self) it comes into being after the formation of the tinat. Therefore, the nafs of each individual is developed after the preparation of the body. It depends on the matter for its development but becomes independent in the process of growth. The ruh exists independently before the matter and remains so, for ever. It, the ruh, never joins the matter and never becomes dependent on it. It acts on the matter. The nafs, with no prior existence as it is only a reaction of the ruh, acts through the body, and when it develops into a state, free from the influence of matter, the ruh operates and makes it independent. Thereafter it neither deteriorates nor becomes dependent again. Through progress and development into a higher state of spirituality, passive mat"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:31]\nNAMES\nAngels are obedient beings. There is no \"becoming\" (change) in the angelic sphere. Each of them has a fixed status to carry out a particular function. Man, on the other hand, made of matter, endowed with vast potentialities and scope for progress and development, is more fit to reflect or to react to the various aspects of the higher will. The potentiality of matter reveals itself in many forms, but it is only through the organism of man that its highly refined potentiality develops into intellect, reason and contemplation, the essential requirements for wisdom and knowledge. According to verse 75 of Sad, Allah has created Adam with His two hands, matter and spirit, which gives man the distinctive power of expression, termed as biyan by the Quran. This expressive power is related to His vicegerency, because the vicegerent, as the representative of the principal, gives expression to His will and command. The higher the ability of recepiency and the reflective power, the greater will be the scope and canvas of representation. It is on this basis that all the messengers and prophets of Allah will be standing under the standard of the Holy Prophet, which will be in the hand of Ali, on the day of resurrection.\nThe names Adam learned from Allah were not in the knowledge of the angels, because these names did not refer to the phenomena known to them. The hum of aradahum does not refer to the \"names\" but to the \"named\", and as a plural term cannot be used for Allah, therefore, it cancels the possibility of interpreting these names as the names of Allah. When reference is made in Arabic to several objects of inanimate nature, a singular feminine pronoun is used, but when the objects are conscious beings, a plural masculine pronoun is used, as done here through aradahum, to point out the \"named ones\". If the object referred to is inanimate, the singular feminine pronoun, tilka or hadhihi should have been used. Here the personal demonstrative pronoun refers to the conscious beings of a superior-most status, knowledge of whose names entitled Adam to the vicegerency of Allah. Thus the existence of the beings of the highest status has been established. Due to the affinity between Adam and these highest beings (alin), he was capable to function as the medium of their manifestation. Verse 4 of al Tin says that the status of man, in the order of creation, is the highest in excellence. The alin, the highest beings, referred to in this verse, are the most perfect and the most blessed human beings, for whose manifestation in the arc of ascent, Adam was chosen. Till then the names of the highest beings along with the insight and vision of their realities, their latent qualities and inherent endowments were unknown to the angels.\n(see commentary for verse 4)(see commentary for verse 2)"

When Adam, at the command of Allah, stated the names, qualities and symbols of those highest beings whose collective and comprehensive status can be termed as wisdom personified, the angels witnessed the glory of the infinite power and wisdom of the Lord that could create such perfect beings of the highest calibre, in substance as well as in style, like of whom they did not know till then.\nIn Durr Manthur, Jalaluddin Sayuti says that the Holy Prophet had said: \"The objects shown to the angels were five lights. Allah informed the angels pointing to each of the lights respectively:\n(i) This is Muhammad, the most praised, derived from My name, the praised one.\n(ii) This is Ali, the high, derived from My name, the highest.\n(iii) This is Fatimah, the original, derived from my name, the originator of the heavens and the earth.\n(iv) This is Hasan, the bountiful, derived from My name, the benefactor.\n(v) This is Husayn, the good, derived from My name, the good in origin.\nO angels! It is in love of these five that I have created the universe.\"\nIt becomes a logical conclusion that since Allah willed these five lights of glory to be manifested through Adam, he had been appointed as the khalifa of Allah, and through these lights Allah's light had been destined to be manifested.\nAs Allah is aware of all the \"unseen\" in the universe, He knew that the angels secretly thought themselves more deserving than Adam to be chosen as Allah's khalifa.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:39]\nThe literal meaning of ayat is sign. Every verse of the Quran is a sign (ayat) because it draws the attention of the reader to its meaning. But Allah's signs, in the perfect sense, are those beings whose holy personalities draw the attention of the human beings to the glory of Allah. Every prophet of Allah, during his time, was a sign of Allah, and the Holy Prophet, the Twelve Imams and Bibi Fatimah are the conclusive signs of Allah. Allah gives a fair warning to those who, under the influence of the eternal enemy of man, Shaytan, go astray from the right path, the path of \"Muhammad and Ali Muhammad\", that their abode will be the fire.\nREVIEW OF VERSES 30 TO 39\nThe term \"Adam\", in the Quran, refers to the first man who came out of a state of ease and comfort to make effort and reach the ultimate excellence. In this journey, within the sphere of time and space, he, as the most well-equipped creature among all the created beings, has, at his disposal, divine guidance, to fight and overcome the obstacles and evil of satanic forces. Prior to the advent of Adam, life on earth for the living beings had no other meaning except to struggle for survival. Adam gave a new significance to life on earth. Man was given the knowledge to learn how to choose between good and evil, right and wrong. Through this knowledge his conscience directed him what to do and what not to do, to adopt harmony and to avoid discord. As Adam came out of the earthly paradise, blessed with the divine guidance, he, due to the potentiality he carried in himself, aspired for the ultimate good, by using all his faculties to curb the drift unto greed, lust, hatred, anger etcetera and walk on the right path.\nThe Holy Prophet says:\nEvery human child is born with the Adam's nature; it is the \"parents\" (the environment) which turns the child into a Jew, a Christian or a Magian.\nMan is originally sinless. The evil takes roots in him through external factors. Therefore, the Christian theory of \"original sin\" has no place in the interpretation of the history of Adam by the Quran. The approaching to the out-of-bounds tree, when he was in the earthly paradise, was prior to his coming into this world, therefore, on account of his record, after shouldering the responsibility of the vicegerency of Allah on the earth, he is clean and sinless.\nAccording to the traditions of Muhammad and Ali Muhammad there were several Adams, which indicate that there may be several worlds like ours. The symbolic value of the advent of Adam is applicable to human life because man is born in the paradise of ease and comfort, and as a child is pure and free from the responsibility of making efforts to fulfil his wants. As he grows to maturity, he has to make use of his faculties to get what he used to have without effort. The sense of duty and responsibility, and the consciousness of good and evil prepare him to fight against satanic forces working against him. It is not possible for him to get out of the trouble caused by the conflicting desires and satanic temptations unless he turns towards the ultimate reality as the sole object of his life. It gives him peace and tranquillity, saves him from fear and grief, does not let him fall from the state of humanity to the state of animal nature. To reach the ultimate reality it is essential to know the holy names because of whom Adam was blessed and forgiven. In these holy persons the divine vicegerency reached its destination. They are Muhammad (Nabuwwat), and his Ahl ul Bayt (Imamat).\nIn view of the creation of man, his responsibilities to the creator and to the institution of divine vicegerency and its continuity on earth till the day of resurrection, as a covenant between \"man and God\", and the submission to the universal will of the absolute, as the law governing all aspects of his life, it is necessary to point out a few guiding factors to have a clear understanding about the beginning and development of the prophetic mission.\nAllah, who alone knows everything, has reserved the right of the appointment of the vicegerent with Himself.\nThe appointment is not an arbitrary act of choosing but the vicegerent is selected on merit after the test of inherent excellence.\nThe created beings, be they angels or prophets, have no right or say in the appointment of the vicegerent. The essential imperative is the knowledge of the holy names which alone help the candidate for the vicegerency to cross terrestrial barriers and reach the glorious heavenly heights in order to establish communion with the universal grace and will of the almighty Lord, as has been observed in the case of Adam.\nAdam conveyed the appointment of Shith, his son, as the vicegerent of Allah to his other children, but a large number of his sons opposed this declaration. The tendency of the majority to revolt against the declared will of Allah is on record, as mentioned in the Quran, throughout the history of the appointments of the prophets of Allah - Nuh, Sam, Ibrahim, Is-haq, Isma-il, Yaqub, Yusuf, Musa, Talut, Dawud, and Isa.\nThe declarations of Musa, and other prophets after him, about the advent of Isa, llyas and the \"promised prophet\" in the progeny of Isma-il and the \"twelve princes\" succeeding him, were opposed tooth and nail by the Jews. The pagan Romans, instigated by the Jews, executed Yahya and put Isa on the cross, but Allah raised him to heaven. Isa announced the coming of the \"Paraclete\" (Muhammad or Ahmed) before he left this world.\nAnd when the promised \"Paraclete\" would come, he will complete the mission by delivering the whole truth and shall never speak but whatsoever he shall hear from the Lord that he shall speak.\n(The Book of John).\nIsa had appointed Simon as his successor and as the rock of divinity on whom the edifice of the faith will be based, but Paul opposed him. To make people discard Simon, Paul claimed the appearance of Isa in his vision, and by accommodating the pagan cult of the Romans he corrupted the true faith and established the orthodox Christian Church.\nThe Holy Prophet, on several occasions, appointed Ali ibna abi Talib as his successor and vicegerent, in compliance with the commands of Allah. Some of the important traditions and the verses of the Quran which make clear and confirm the vicegerency of Ali ibna abi Talib have been mentioned in the \"Essentials for the readers of the Quran\" (page 1 to 7), and in the commentary of verses 2 and 30 to 39 of this surah. From his birth in the holy Kabah to the \"tradition of qartas\", there are several events and occasions, recorded by well-known Muslim scholars in many books of history, traditions and commentaries (mentioned in the commentary of relevant verses in this book) which can be referred to for arriving at the conclusion that in his own right and on the basis of his matchless merits, he alone was the divinely chosen vicegerent to succeed the Holy Prophet.\nSome of the titles of Ali ibna abi Talib, which are exclusively his, are given below:\n    Mawlud Kabah - Born in the house of Allah.\n    Nafs al Rasul - The \"self\" of the messenger.\n    Kullu Iman - The total faith.\n    La Fata - The hero who has no equal.\n    Karrar Ghayra Farrar - The unconquerable attacker who never runs away from the battlefield.\n    Bab al Ilm - The gateway to wisdom.\n    Al Murtada - The chosen (by Allah).\n    Amir al Muminin - The commander of the faithful.\n    Imam al Muttaqin - The leader of the pious.\n    Mazhar al Aja-ib The manifestor of wonders.\n    Imam al Awliya - The original source of the friends of Allah who seek His closest nearness.\n    Sayyid al Awsiya - The chief (or the first) of the successors of the Holy Prophet.\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

In view of these undeniable facts the Christian Church had no alternative but to give currency to the belief in the second advent of Isa. Musa and Muhammad were the law-givers, whereas Isa was the follower of the laws preached by Musa. Therefore, the phrase \"like you\" applies to Muhammad, not to Isa.\nSimilarities between Muhammad and Musa are many. No two prophets, in historical background, resembled each other more than these two. It must also be noted that Allah helped and protected Musa through his brother Harun and Muhammad through his brother Ali.\nReference has been made here to the covenant taken from the Bani Israil to believe in the Holy Prophet and walk in the way of the Lord.

The chosen people also will be judged in view of their actions.\nIf \"nor shall intercession be accepted\" is not understood by knowing its particular use in this verse, and by making reference to other verses of the Quran in this connection, every ordinary reader comes to a wrong conclusion.\nAllah has prescribed for Himself mercy (An-am: 12 and 54), and says in verse 87 of Yusuf that verily, none despairs of Allah's mercy save disbelieving people. The just Allah is also the merciful Lord. His mercy conditions His justice.\nThe verses, which make certain that in the divine scheme of reward and punishment the \"institution\" of intercession has been firmly established, are quoted below:\nWho can intercede with Him, except by His permission.\n(BAQARAH: 255)\nThey shall have no power of intercession, save he who has taken a promise from the merciful.\n(MARYAM: 87)\nOn that day no intercession avails, save (that of) him to whom the merciful has given permission and whose word He accepts.\n(TAHA: 109)\nThere is no intercessor save after His permission;\n(YUNUS: 3)\nThere are several such verses in the Quran which prove untrue the theory of non-availability of intercession propagated by a misguided school of thought among the Muslims.\nThe Holy Prophet and the thoroughly purified Imams (Ahzab: 33) are those upon whom Allah has bestowed (an-amta alayhim - Fatihah :7) the power of intercession.\nThe word shafa (to pair or to join a thing to its like) is the root of shafa-at, which means intercession. It can be favourable or unfavourable, as per verse 85 of al Nisa. It signifies the loving attachment of a person with his ideal or model whom he follows. On the day of judgement the wicked and the virtuous will be separated, therefore, it will be a day of pairing of the souls according to their affinity and attachment in this world - \"remember the day when We will summon every people with their Imam (leader)\", says verse 71 of Bani Israil.\nThe inadmissibility of intercession here is in the case of those who not only do not avoid evil but make a choice of wickedness as their mode of life; which is the direct result of their wilful rejection of the path of the thoroughly purified, adherence to whose guidance would have saved them from eternal damnation.\nIt is this despair of the non-availability of Allah's mercy which had compelled the founders of the Christian Church to invent the doctrine of atonement - God, in order to pardon man, in spite of His justice, incarnated Himself into the form a begotten son, called Jesus, and then got Himself killed so that the price of the sins of man be paid. This unreasonable idea of redemption gives man licence to sin as and when he likes.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe word yawm, in this verse, refers to the life of the hereafter which includes the term of life beginning with the departure of the soul till the final resurrection. In some verses of the Quran it is said that every human being will undergo a trial on the day of final resurrection as an individual, whereas some other verses suggest groups of people, along with their leaders, will come before the Lord. According to some verses the wicked will be condemned without being permitted to put forward their lame excuses, whereas other state that some of the wicked will accuse their leaders for misleading them. There is no contradiction. In fact there are several varying stages in the intermediary period as well as in the final phase. The examination of every soul according to its individual deeds may differ from the accountability of its social behaviour. A man may be condemned as an individual but on account of his attachment to the divinely chosen wasilah (support and influence), he may be redeemed. The Quran, in many places, asserts the effectiveness of intercession, therefore, the negation here either refers to a particular condition or to the fact that no intercession offered by a soul on its own behalf shall be accepted. Only those who have been authorised by Allah shall have the right to intercede.\nThe wavering between belief and disbelief by the Bani Israil is also visible among the followers of other prophets. All the messengers of Allah patiently put up with this kind of attitude in order to check desertion in the early stages of the propagation of the faith. Drift from the truth and reversion to falsehood was discouraged, and the doors of repentance were kept open, but only a few took advantage of the leniency.\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

In general, it is a reminder to all who have been saved from past afflictions and given the knowledge of wisdom arising from such circumstances. The details of their sorry plight under the Fir-awns have been given in the old testament:\nSo they (Egyptians) treated their Israelite slaves with ruthless severity, and made life bitter for them with servitude setting them to work on clay and brick-making, and all sorts of work in the fields. In short they made ruthless use of them as slaves in every kind of hard labour. Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives: \"When you are attending the Hebrew women in childbirth, watch as the child is delivered and if it is a boy, kill him; if it is a girl, let her live.\"\n(Exodus 1: 13 to 16)\nAllah kept them safe from the King's designs:\nBut they were god-fearing women. They did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do, but let the boys live. So he summoned those Hebrew midwives and asked them why they had done this and let the boys live. They told Firawn that Hebrew women were not like Egyptian women. When they were in labour they gave birth before the midwife could get to them. So God made the midwives prosper, and the people (Israelites) increased in number and in strength.\n(Exodus-1: 17 to 20)\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

In this way Allah saved the Bani Israil because at that time they were in submission to the truth.\nA detailed account of the event is given in the old testament. Please refer to Exodus 14: 1 to 31.\nTo escape from the pursuing Fir-awn and his army Musa and his followers reached the Red Sea. Fir-awn was almost upon them when the Jews looked up and saw the Egyptians close behind. Then Allah commanded Musa to strike the water with his rod, as there were no boats to carry them across the sea. Musa did as was told. A dry path appeared. They easily reached the other side After their crossing\nFir-awn with his army followed the same path but in midway the water in the sea again began to flow and the pursuing enemy was drowned, while the Bani Israil were watching from the shore. Also refer to verse 90 of Yunus.\nSince a self-appointed prophet, the founder of the Ahmadi school, could not rise above the level of ordinary human beings, he tried to deprive every genuine prophet of Allah of the special honours Allah had bestowed upon His chosen representatives. To him there is no extraordinary (miraculous) aspect in this occurrence. He and his followers do not believe in the divinely endowed spiritual strength of the true prophets of Allah. They say that bahr means a river, not sea (which is not true according to Arabic literature); and that at the time when Musa and his followers crossed, it was shallow, but the army of Firawn was swept away by a tide. In the line of wilful misinterpretation it is forgotten that the tide which saved Musa and his followers from the pursuit of the Firawn's army was a miracle, else how could the coming of tide in shallow waters be justified, unless it is attributed to the will of Allah.\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

According to verse 142 of al Araf the stay was for thirty days, but subsequently the term was extended by ten more days. The delay created doubts in the minds of the Bani Israil about the genuineness of the prophethood of Musa, and unjustly they took up the worship of the calf.\nMusa had appointed his brother, Harun, as his successor and deputy, during his absence. Likewise the Holy Prophet, at the time of migrating to Madina from Makka, had chosen Ali to sleep in his bed, during the night of hijrat, and to return the deposits, kept in trust with him, to the owners; commissioned Ali to take charge of the administration in Madina when he went to Tabuk to encounter the enemy; and he had also assigned to Ali the responsibility of delivering al Barat to the people of Makka, because as per the divine command only he or Ali could deliver the divine revelation. \"Ali is to me as Harun was to Musa\", declared the Holy Prophet. As the people of Musa violated their oath of loyalty to Harun and followed Samayri the magician, the ummah of Muhammad also turned their back upon Ali and pursued their own fancies. In this way the iman of the people was tested, and they were found doing injustice to themselves. As stated in verse 3 of this surah a true believer must believe in the unseen. In view of the limitations of human wisdom, reliance upon the divinely chosen guides is the surest way to the right path. If one does not follow the Holy Prophet and his divinely chosen holy Imams, it is the deviator who suffers the consequences by being unjust to himself because the guides remain independent of the mischief of the deserters.\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

The lightning appeared on the demand of the people, therefore, it was not a punishment, and the word mawt refers to cessation of life, not stupor, as the Ahmadi commentator tries to misinterpret this verse. In verse 143 of al Araf wa kharra Musa sa-iqa means Musa fell down senseless, and falamma afaqa means when he recovered, whereas, here, in the case of the elders the word mawt (death or cessation of life) and ba-atha (raising after death) are used.\nThe tendency of Ahmadi commentators to deny miracles is the result of the lack of ability to understand the intellectual development of mankind. The historical events and the reactions of the people in the days of Musa and other prophets are recorded in the Bible. In those days miracles were frequently manifested to convince the people who were not aware of the laws governing the operation of creation, and therefore, could not be convinced through rational arguments.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe people asked Musa to show them the proof of his prophethood by requesting Allah to appear in person. In their foolishness they did not know that corporeality is for the creatures, not for the uncreated creator, therefore, their demand was met by another proof - the raising after death.\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

This is how the Bani Israil became the murderers of the prophets of Allah because they all came with one message:\n\"There is no god save Allah.\"\nAnd you say \"If we had been alive in our father's time, we should never have taken part with them in the murder of the prophets.\"\n(Matthew 23: 30)\n\"I send you therefore prophets, sages, and teachers; some of them you will kill and crucify, others you will flog in your synagogues and hound from city to city.

First they ignored the high status of the Ahl ul Bayt and then deprived them of their rights; ultimately they killed the holy Imams one by one. So, those who hear or write or read the accounts of the sufferings of the holy Imams caused by the people, with whom they feel closely associated in one way or the other, and quietly ignore their heinous crimes without expressing dislike, disgust and contempt, should be held responsible for those crimes as if they themselves have committed them. Particularly in the case of Imam Husayn, such persons will stand in the row of the actual murderers on the day of judgement.\nCovetous for the material products of the earth, dissatisfied with the heavenly (spiritual) aspects of life, a better nourishment, the Bani Israil fell into abasement and humiliation, because they exchanged that which was better for that which was worse.\nTo know the behaviour of the Bani Israil, please refer to Numbers 11: 1 to 27 .\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

When a case like this actually took place the Bani Israil rebelled, argued, doubted and rejected the doctrine of truthful submission and guidance. They insisted that Musa should pray to Allah to reveal the name of the murderer, which Musa was rightly refusing because it was contrary to the divine laws in force. In fact it was a conspiracy to test the prophetic powers of Musa. In answer, Allah commanded them to sacrifice a cow. They were greatly disturbed by this command because under the influence of the heathen ideologies, cows and bulls were held in high veneration. They again started to pester Musa with endless questions. They thought that narrowing down the specification of the cow would result in non-availability of such an animal. Imam Ali bin Musa al Rida has rightly observed that any cow would have been sufficient, but the more the Bani Israil made a fuss, the more did Allah impose restrictions as a punishment to their persistent demands for unnecessary details. Musa, under the divine command, was able to make them purchase the prescribed cow by paying a large sum to a very holy and pious man who owned such a cow. It was a reluctant compliance.\nThe cow was slain and its tail was put on the sacrum of the dead man. The dead man came to life and pointed out the same man as the murderer, who had raised the cry for his blood-money. The murderer was his nephew. The body was concealed in a nearby village. The Bani Israil, as said above, wanted to test Musa. They were sure that Musa had no means of finding out the murderer to the full satisfaction of the people. The unfolding event proved their limitations. Allah brought forth that which they were going to hide.\nThe patience of the prophet of Allah with the doubters is a proof of his divinely inspired concern for the people. In a similar way, after the departure of the Holy Prophet, many of the Muslims quarrelled over his judgement and doubted his will and intention that Ali ibna abi Talib should lead and establish Islam-original.\nSince all human beings have been created by Allah, killing a person and what he represents is like destroying the entire creation (see verse 32 of al Ma-idah).\nThe Ahmadi commentator says that the meaning of qatl in verse 72 is \"almost dead\" and refers to verses 157 and 158 of al Nisa wherein \"the raising of Isa alive unto Allah\" has been mentioned, and tries to make people believe that this verse also refers to Isa. In his zeal to fabricate falsehood he has overlooked the sentence: \"And Allah brings forth what you hide\". The Jews had no doubt about the crucifixion of Isa, nor concealed it, nor did they dispute about it. It makes clear that the Ahmadi school does not believe in the omnipotent power of Allah.\n(see commentary for verse 4)"

They are enclosed in error. Sinning becomes their nature, as the conscience is paralysed. Total abandonment to evil obtains eternal punishment. They are the people of hell. Man finds himself in such a hopeless situation only when he breaks the covenant made with the Lord and disconnects all links of attachment with the divinely commissioned guides (Baqarah: 38). Even a little liking for the goodness of the holy Imams may change the lifestyle of a habitual sinner.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:84]\nIbna Hisham in \"Siratun Nabi\", and Amir Ali in the \"Spirit of Islam\" say that this reminder is directed to the Bani Israil, who entered into a treaty with the Holy Prophet at Madina.\nA few clauses are quoted below:\n\"Whosoever is rebellious, or seeks to spread enmity and sedition, the hand of every man shall be against him, even if he be a son. Whosoever of the Jews follows us shall have aid and succour; they shall not be injured, nor shall any enemy be aided against them. The Jewish clans in alliance with the several tribes of Madina are one people with the believers. The Jews will profess their religion, the Muslims theirs. As with the Jews, so with their adherents. No one shall go forth to war excepting with the permission of Muhammad, but this shall not hinder any from seeking lawful revenge. The Jews shall be responsible for their expenditure, the Muslims for theirs, but if attacked each shall come to the assistance of the other. Madina shall be sacred and inviolable for all that join this treaty; controversies and disputes shall be referred to for the decision of God and His Prophet. None shall join the men of Makka or their allies, for verily the engaging parties are bound together against every one that shall threaten Madina. War and peace shall be made in common.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAlthough the Jews acknowledged and witnessed the divine command not to shed blood of their people, nor drive them away out of their habitations, yet they transgressed. This Jewish attitude was conspicuously noticeable in the nature of the Muslim ummah, when they killed, tormented and abused the holy family of the Holy Prophet in Kerbala and after Kerbala.\nImam Ali bin Husayn al Zaynul Abidin had said:\nIn view of the clear instructions of the Holy Prophet and the decisive injunctions of the Quran it is obligatory to love, revere and follow the Ahl ul Bayt, but, even if the prophet had commanded the ummah to hate and abuse his children, they could not have been able to do worse than what they did to us.\nThey persecuted the Ahl ul Bayt in whichever town they took shelter, forced them to drift from place to place, and at last surrounded them from all sides in the desert of Kerbala, and then murdered in cold blood, all the male friends, relatives and companions of Imam Husayn, the grandson of the Holy Prophet They spared no one, not even the six month infant son of the Holy Imam. The persecutors, in devilish frenzy, trampled the bodies of the devoted martyrs under the hooves of their horses, plundered, looted and set the tents of the Ahl ul Bayt on fire. It was a premeditated, ruthless and satanic dance of death. The ladies and children of the holy house in chains, along with the severed heads of the martyrs, walked through the streets of Kufa and Damascus (to the court of Yazid). The tragedy of Kerbala casts a gloom upon every refined, compassionate and God-fearing soul. It makes hearts bleed, and tears flow. Cries of lamentation reach the heavens.\nIn the court of Yazid, Bibi Zaynab binta Ali stood up and said in a clear, definite and strong voice:\nO Yazid! What would the Holy Prophet say if he sees us in this condition today? Think you O Yazid, that by killing our men and capturing us and reducing us to this state, you have won and we have lost? Then verily you are mistaken. Our cause has been established by Allah and no power on earth can ever do it any harm. The temporal power which you assume is to be counted but only for a very few days and then you shall feel sorry for your tyranny but it shall be in vain. The divine kingdom is with us and shall remain with us for ever. All that you possess is nothing but a passing show and there is nothing divine in it. Verily, Satan holds power on the earth more than all the tyrants together but in the eyes of Allah he is the cursed and the derided one. It appears that sins have encompassed your heart and severed all the links of faith and made you bold to utter the proud words against the truth. \"Have they not travelled on the earth and seen how the others before them had met their end? They were far more powerful than them, dug up the earth and built far more than what did they build; and their messengers came to them with clear proofs. It was not for Allah to wrong them, they wronged themselves. Then evil was the end of those who did evil, for they belied the signs of Allah and made fun of them.\"\n"

It is, as far as we know, a very highly refined spiritual entity whose function is to guide, inspire and infuse the prophetic spirit. It also equips the divinely selected individual to exercise miraculous powers.\nAn impostor, who did not have such a spirit or an angel to guide him, yet claimed prophethood, interprets ruh as guidance, which every virtuous individual receives from Allah. According to him, even the help which prophet Isa received from Allah was merely in the form of guidance. In this way he purposely tries to discredit every true messenger of Allah from having any angelic service at his command.\nThe repeated mention of ruhul quds in connection with the prophet Isa clearly establishes the fact that he was particularly chosen for this distinction.\nPlease refer to the following verses wherein the word holy spirit or spirit has been used:\nAL BAQARAH: 253\nAL MA-IDAH: 110\nAL NAHL: 102\nAL MUMIN: 15\nAL SHURA: 52\nAL MUJADILAH: 22\nAL NABA: 38\nAL QADR: 4\nThrough fa-fariqan kadhdhabtum, the obstinate refusal to believe in the true messengers of Allah,\nand to carry out those commands which do not serve selfish interests, is disclosed.\nIn fariqan taqtuluna, the change of tense from the past to the present refers to the attempts the Jews were making to kill the Holy Prophet.\n"

This preposterous idea made them deny the Holy Prophet in spite of the clear proofs available in their book (see commentary of verse 40 of this surah).\n\"Desire death, if you are truthful\", is a challenge. Tamannul Mawta means desire or wish (not invoke or pray) death. If they were so specially favoured by Allah, they did not have to even take the trouble of praying for death; merely desiring it would have received His response. He who loves Allah loves death -to depart from this world and enter the eternal land of bliss and happiness. Also refer to verses 6 and 7 of al Jumu-ah. Everyone of the holy Ahl ul Bayt was always prepared for death and loved it. After receiving the fatal blow Imam Ali said: \"By the Lord of the holy Kabah, I have attained success.\"\nThe conviction of the Jews was not genuine. They did not believe in what they said. Aware of their own misdeeds, and the way they had corrupted their books, they could not desire death for themselves. On the other hand they were plotting to kill the Holy Prophet, because they knew that the Holy Prophet was a true prophet of Allah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"Desire death, if you are truthful\" is an open challenge. Whoso thinks that the blissful life of the hereafter is exclusively his must always be ready to die. He who is sure of a better life in the hereafter, as the favour of Allah, would not like to prolong his earthly life but would expedite his departure from here. According to Imam Ali, a genuine devotee, the lover or the favourite of Allah, would not let his soul stay in his body for fraction of a moment if his term of life has not been ordained by Allah, because he knows what awaits him in the life of the hereafter. Therefore he is never afraid of death.\nImam Ali said:\n\"Verily, by Allah I declare that the son of Abu Talib is more familiar with death than a baby is with the breast of his mother.\"\nTherefore, neither the greed for power nor the fear of death, as the opponents of Ali used to think, was the reason for his outspoken analysis of the behaviour of his contemporaries, or his silence in the midst of ruthless deviators and hypocrites.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:97]\nAccording to the book of Daniel (12: 1) , Mika-il is the great captain who stands guard over the Jews. So Mika-il was their guardian angel. They disliked Jibra-il, who they thought, always brought punishment. It was Jibra-il through whom the prophets came to know the perverse behaviour of the Jews, and, therefore, they cursed the Jews. It was Jibra-il who announced the birth of John the Baptist, and conveyed the glad tidings to virgin Maryam about the birth of Isa whom the Jews obstinately hated. It was Jibra-il who saved Nebuchadnezzar from their clutches when he was a boy, and he, afterwards, destroyed their temple. Jibra-il was their enemy. This prejudice led them to believe that he was asked to convey the office of prophethood to one of the Jews but he inadvertently went to the Holy Prophet. Abdulla bin Suriya, a Jew, came to the Holy Prophet and asked some questions to test his genuineness. He was convinced that Muhammad was a true messenger of Allah, but when he came to know that it was Jibra-il who conveyed the divine message, he said that he would not believe in his prophethood because Jibra-il was the enemy of the Jews. In fact, the Jews were the enemies of Jibra-il, who brought Allah's commands and revelations to His prophets, which contained guidance and good news for the believers. Whosoever is the enemy of Allah, His messengers and His angels is an unbeliever. Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers who are described as infidels. Therefore, those who troubled, tortured and killed the Ahl ul Bayt, the beloved darlings of the Holy Prophet and Allah, are the enemies of the Holy Prophet and Allah. When the Holy Prophet was leaving this world to meet his creator, the so-called followers of the true religion of Allah deserted him and held a conference in Saqifa to choose a ruler in complete disregard to their oath of allegiance, which they had promised to uphold, at Ghadir Khum, just a few months before. They had accepted Ali as their Mawla, but soon after the departure of the Holy Prophet, they deprived Ali of his right to succeed the Holy Prophet, and, to show their power in this world, arrested him and dragged him to the court of the ruler. The daughter of the Holy Prophet, Bibi Fatima Zahra, was not only publicly insulted during the trial of Fadak, but that which the Holy Prophet had given her by the command of Allah was taken away from her, and her house was also set on fire. An aggressor kicked the door of her house which fell on her and killed the child she was carrying in her womb, and which finally proved to be the cause of her death. Ali was killed in the mosque. Hasan, the grandson of the Holy Prophet was killed by poison. Husayn, the other grandson of the Holy Prophet, and his friends and relatives, were slain in Kerbala, and the ladies of the holy family were chained, tortured and held captive for a long time. One after the other, the Holy Imams were killed. Sayyids, the sons and daughters of the family of Ahl ul Bayt, were hunted, captured and were either murdered or tortured. Those who were responsible, directly or indirectly, for such heinous crimes are certainly the enemies of the Holy Prophet, because no reasonable person can say that these were the acts of friends. Such people are unbelievers, and Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers. In verse 57 of al Ahzab, Allah has cursed those who annoy or displease Allah and His messenger in this world and has prepared a painful punishment for them in the hereafter. The Holy Prophet said:\n\"O Ali! Your flesh is my flesh, your blood is my blood. He who fights you, in fact has declared war against me, and to fight against me is to fight Allah.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAngels and angelic functions have been explained in the commentary of the earlier verses of this surah. Now the functions of the four arch-angels are given below:\n(1) JIBRA-IL\nHe communicated the will of Allah to His messengers. He also destroyed the enemies of Allah and His messengers.\n(2) MIKA-IL\nHe supplies nourishment and provisions.\n(3) ISRAFIL\nHe gives forms and shapes. He also assimilates nature.\n(4) IZRA-IL\nHe disengages living beings from one state of existence to initiate into another state of existence .\nThese are, in fact the functions of the rububiyat, the cherishing aspect of Allah's grace. There are many angels working under the arch-angels. The various angelic functions are closely linked together. One cannot function without the other. The single exclusive authority of Allah controls these functions according to His supreme will. So, there is no room for the angels to act in contravention to the command of Allah. Only ignorant fools indulge in the theory of possible disobedience by the angels. In verse 6 of al Tahrim, the almighty Allah says that the angels do not disobey Him in that which He commands them; they do that which they are commanded to do.\nWhen various agencies represent one and the same authority, hostility directed towards any will include all and finally lead to the original source, as has been correctly pointed out in verses 152 to 154 of al Nisa.\n"

To discredit him in the eyes of the people the devils had forged a book in the name of Sulayman on the art of sorcery in order to give currency to the idea that it was witchcraft, not divine endowment, through which Sulayman directed the operation of created phenomena and exercised various super natural acts. As sorcery demands belief in ungodly agencies and false deities, he who makes use of witchcraft is an infidel. To cast aspersion on the prophet of Allah was a blasphemy. Sulayman worshipped the true God (Yahweh). He was not an unbeliever. It was the devilish beings who disbelieved .\nThough it cannot be directly observed. the good and evil spirits are capable of corporeal manifestation. To invoke the agency of evil spirits in order to effect magic is infidelity, and is therefore condemned by Islam. In Babylon and other centres of old civilisation sorcery was in vogue. It was used to confuse the people because they could not distinguish between witchcraft and genuine miracles. To counter this devilish scheme two angels, Harut and Marut, were sent down by Allah to help the prophet of that time. By providing him with the means of undoing the effects of sorcery, the people were properly equipped to discriminate between right and wrong, truth and falsehood. During the time of the Holy Prophet a large number of Jews practised sorcery and adopted it as their creed by setting aside the Tawrat.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAccording to the first book of Kings 11: 1 to 11, in the Old Testament, Sulayman defected from true worship and the Lord was angry with him because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel. This verse refutes the Jewish allegation. The following inferences can be drawn from this verse:\n(1) Sorcery is not altogether ineffective.\n(2) Sorcery can do no harm if Allah so wills.\n(3) To learn witchcraft or sorcery is not profitable, but harmful.\n(4) Those who go after the art of sorcery and witchcraft will have no share of good in the hereafter, because it is as bad as mischief-making. To dispel the effects of witchcraft and sorcery people are allowed to learn the art of defending themselves.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:104]\nThe doubters, and all those with the outlook of Bani Israil, take to twisting any word necessary to suit their purpose. Ra-ina means \"listen to us\", but it was turned by a little twist in accent into a word of reproach (meaning \"stupid\") by the Jews (also refer to verse 46 of al Nisa). Therefore the word unzurna (look upon us) was suggested which gave no room to the enemy for casting aspersion on the Holy Prophet. This verse shows how much the Jews disliked the Holy Prophet. It also prohibits use of any word bearing sinister meaning with reference to him.\nThe Jews and the idol-worshippers did not like that khayr (good), the Quran, should be revealed to the Holy Prophet. As \"the mercy unto the worlds\" the Holy Prophet himself was khayr because khayr (good) is rahmah (mercy). He, the last law-giver messenger of Allah, was a descendant of prophet Ismail, the younger son of prophet Ibrahim, therefore, the Jews, who were the descendants of prophet Ishaq, the elder son of prophet Ibrahim, did not like the advent of the promised prophet in the progeny of prophet Ismail. They knew that the ministry of the Holy Prophet was genuine and Islam was the true religion of Allah, but their prejudice and envy led them astray. The same prejudice and envy created the venomous group of the hypocrites (munafiqin) who opposed the Holy Prophet in his lifetime, and, after him, persecuted, murdered and tried to destroy completely his Ahl ul Bayt. The hatred of the Israelites against the non-Israelites was reflected in the hatred of the non-Hashimites against the Hashimites. Allah chooses whom He pleases for His mercy and grace (also refer to verses 90 and 91 of this surah).\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAn interesting conversation between the second caliph and Ibna Abbas, recorded by Tabari and other historians, is quoted below, which throws light on the influence of the Jewish mentality on the behaviour and mental attitude of the non-Hashimite Muslims.\nThe second caliph said:\n\"O son of Abbas! Do you know why your family has been deprived of Khilafat? The Quraysh did not like that prophethood (nubuwwat) and vicegerency (khilafat) be combined in the family of Hashim, lest their vanity increases. So they chose some one else, really their choice was good.\"\nIbna Abbas said:\n\"There is nothing unusual so far as the hatred of the Quraysh for the family of Hashim is concerned, because right from the beginning they did not like the message, nor the messenger. 'That is because they were averse to what Allah has sent down, so He shall render their deeds null and void (Muhammad: 9)'. And the apprehension about the vanity of the people who have been (thoroughly) purified, by Allah himself, from every type of uncleanness is an (unfounded) accusation. It would have been most appropriate if the Quraysh had chosen he whom Allah had chosen, and ..\"\nAt this stage the caliph interrupted and said:\n\"Behold! O son of Abbas! I have already been informed about your utterances. Beware! You may fall in my estimation.\"\nIbna Abbas said:\n\"Yes. If my opinions are true, they should not cause my downfall, and if they be untrue, you should remind me to put them in order.\"\nThe caliph got angry and left the place.\nThis incident, sharply defines the most vital issue which divided the Muslims into various schools of thought .\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:106]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nNaskh, as a Quranic term, means substitution of one current law by another. It is called bada if the substitution is in the law of creation, and naskh if it is in the law of legislation.\nSubstitution has been effected in \"creation\" as well as in \"legislation\". The sudden changes in the course of creation, caused by the supreme will of Allah, a factor apparently incomprehensible for the human intellect, are known as miracles - like the birth of Adam and Isa, and the extraordinary performances carried out by the prophets and divinely chosen representatives of Allah. These miracles cannot be taken as effects without any cause, but are caused by a factor inconceivable by the human intellect. The effect of the creature's prayer in the course of providence is also based on the phenomenon of bada. These types of activities on the part of the creatures are a reaction to the divine action. They are governed by the possibility of bada, provided there is no contradiction. For example the \"creation of a self-existing being\" is a self-contradictory idea. Allah alone is the self-existing creator, and what He creates cannot be self-existing. The term \"creation\" itself suggests that it is not self-existing but was created whereas the term \"self-existing\" means that it was not created by anyone. Another example is of an \"even number\". It is impossible to stop it from being divided into two equal whole numbers. In view of the infinite power, possibilities and potentialities at the command of Allah it has been believed and accepted that every known operation in the creation can be changed, substituted or abrogated by His supreme will or action. The human knowledge may not comprehend the use of that which has happened and that which will happen, in the sphere of bada. It must be kept in mind that there can be no limitation to the power and ability of Allah. Imam Ali ibna Abi Talib says: \"Allah has effected changes (bada) and will also effect many changes in the operation (system) of the universe.\"\nChange {Naskh) in the \"legislation\" became necessary due to the gradual development of the human society. Though the spirit might have been the same but the laws and teachings for mankind in a developed society had to be other than what they were in the primitive age. The conditions and circumstances of a particular age do not appear again. There are teachings, applicable in every age, but they, keeping the essential spirit intact, take to new forms till they reach the final stage. From Adam to Muhammad, the divinely appointed teachers took into consideration the receptive capacity of the people. For example prophet Isa, knowing the limitations of his people, put off the delivery of the final message and asked them to wait for the promised prophet.\nThere is still much that I could say to you, but the burden would be too great for you now. However, when he comes who is the spirit of truth, he will guide you into all the truth: for he will not speak on his own authority, but will tell only what he hears; and he will make known to you the things that are coming.\n(John 16: 19 and 13)\nThe divine order \"to do\" or \"not to do\" a thing is based upon reason - alms should be given for helping the poor; or liquor is prohibited in order to avoid its ill-effects. The justifying reason is in the thing ordered to be done or not to be done.\nSometimes the justifying reason is in the order itself. This is true of the orders issued merely as a test of the obedience of the believers. For example, the change in the direction of Qiblah was made (Baqarah: 149) to test the obedience of the believers; or when prophet Ibrahim was asked to sacrifice his son\nIn the first category naskh takes place only when the substitution is necessary in view of the new development. In the second category change is made, without making less its scope and intensity, so that it may fully serve the purpose of the trial. Through naskh as well as bada the withdrawal of the previous procedure or legislation is made known. If the time-limit has already been prescribed for any law or procedure then the term naskh or bada cannot be used. Every aspect of the creation or the legislation, together with their possible manifestations, are known to the creator. Naskh or bada (substitution) cannot be attributed to Allah's ignorance or change of mind. These terms are used in relation to the creatures' knowledge of the divine will. Some orders or processes carry the restriction of the period of validity at the time of their revelation in which case the term bada or naskh cannot be applied. Sometimes it manifests afterwards. In both cases of naskh and bada, the change or substitution means notification of the discontinuation of the procedure or legislation which was in force. In connection with the events of creation or the procedures of legislation the prophets of Allah, now and then, received definite revelations about the taking place of an event, with its details, without any possibility of any change; and at times the nature of the predictions of the consequences of an act was indefinite, which, subject to conditions, could be changed. When the development reaches the ultimate stage, as verse 115 of al An-am says, there is no changing in His words. In the gradual revelation of the laws to the Holy Prophet, no abrogation of any portion of the Quran has been effected. It is generally believed that some Quranic laws, had been abrogated by its own verses, or by the sayings of the Holy Prophet; a list of which has been prepared by the jurists and the commentators, but the context of the traditions, in view of the external evidence, has been, with ulterior motives, twisted and misapplied. A careful study of the Quran with a thorough knowledge of the conclusively proved laws of the faith, passed on to us by the Holy Ahl ul Bayt, the divinely chosen purified custodians of the word of Allah, makes clear the view and proves that there are very few, not exceeding five, abrogations; and even those cannot be described as real or actual naskh. For example the order to pay alms in verse 12 of al Mujadalah was given to test the sincerity of the persons who wanted to meet and talk to the Holy Prophet privately, because most of the companions, without any reason at all, sought his audience for the sake of personal vanity. After this order none paid the prescribed alms save Ali. The purpose of the test was to make public the insincerity of the companions, therefore, it was removed when their deception was proved. This order was totally withdrawn, after condemning the niggardly attitude of the companions, in verse 13 of al Mujadalah. This order resembles the order given to prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son. When it was proved beyond doubt that Ibrahim was certainly carrying out the divine command, the order was withheld (Saffat: 103 to 107). In the same manner when only Ali carried out the order of verse 12 of al Mujadalah, it was proved that he alone, and no one else among the companions, was in the category of prophet Ibrahim, therefore, the order was withdrawn.\nAs the Holy Prophet said, theoretically his sayings could change or substitute (naskh) the Quranic laws. Such change or abrogation can be accepted if reported on the authority of the thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt, because traditions reported through other sources are conflicting and spurious.\nIn every age, among all human societies, in different parts of the earth, the representatives of Allah were sent to put in order the affairs of the people through laws applicable to the time and environment in which they lived. Ability of man to apply reason and understand things and events progressed and advanced with the passage of time, therefore, certain laws and commandments (pertaining to theoretical, practical, intellectual, religious and legal matters concerning day to day life) which bring harmony and peace in every aspect of existence upon the earth, as well as make man ready to explore the higher regions of spiritual satisfaction, in certain cases and circumstances had to be changed or substituted to pave way for further progress. At last the last messenger of Allah, the greatest and the most manifest sign of Allah (the term Ayat or sign taken in a broader and higher sense means the best human soul created), endowed with the divine wisdom, power and authority, was sent to give effect to the concluding part of the plan of educating and training for the final unification of mankind through the true knowledge of the immediate as well as the ultimate. In the chain of the prophets of Allah, among whom some had been made to excel others (Baqarah: 253), the last prophet, Muhammad al Mustafa, the superior-most, the seal of prophethood, came with the final discipline and guidance. Once the development had reached its maximum height, there remained no need for any further change of any kind. Therefore, no prophet was sent after his departure (see commentary of verse 7 of al Fatihah), but a man like him, after him, is necessary as an Imam, in every age, for the authentic, true, and proper explanation of the word of Allah, the Quran, and also to serve as an ideal to guide and keep mankind on the right path. The following saying of the Holy Prophet is a true interpretation of this verse:\nThe first of us is Muhammad,\nthe middle of us is Muhammad,\nthe last of us is Muhammad,\neveryone of us is Muhammad.\nOnly men of understanding know that the same quality of divine energy which activated the prophethood was also manifested in imamat with equal force.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:115]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nWajh means face - the manifesting aspect (side) of a thing. Imam Ali ibna Abi Talib says:\nBeyond this moon are many moons, beyond the sun are many suns\".\n(Bihar ul Anwar).\nThe east and the west mentioned here should not be confined to the directions we know in relation to the rising and setting of the sun. It also refers to the whole cosmos where there are several moons and suns, therefore, the hold of the omnipotence of Allah, the absolute, controls and directs (manifest) in all the easts and the wests of the universe. He is the all-pervading omniscient who is in everything and everything is in Him. His manifestation (wajh) serves the purpose of man. In whichever direction the mind turns there is His manifestation. (Araf: 137, Shu-ara: 28, Saffat: 5, Zukhruf: 38, Rahman: 17). The interpretation of wajh, as Allah's purpose, by the Ahmadi commentator, is a linguistic misappropriation to effect a motivated confusion.\nThe verb sharaqa means to beam or radiate with light. It may be physical or spiritual (Zumar: 69). The place or the direction from which the light beams is mashriq (the east), and the place or direction in which the light disappears is maghrib (the west). The terms mashriq and maghrib should be taken in a wider and more comprehensive sense to include all the lights, physical and spiritual, coming from the absolute to enlighten the various spheres of existence in the universe. In this sense Allah is the wasi-un alim.\nThe first creation in which the unity of the absolute is manifested is known as mashriqul wujud, and the matter in which the unity disappears and gives its place to multiplicity is known as maghribul wujud. On the other hand, as regards to the multiplicity of manifestation the matter can be taken as the mashriq of the multiplicity and the absolute as its maghrib wherein the multiplicity disappears. These are some examples of the various usages of the terms mashriq and maghrib in their singular, plural and dual forms. The particular incident of the revelation of this verse relating to the direction of qiblah (noted below) does not affect the universality which this verse signifies.\n\"This verse was revealed when the companions, who were sent to fight a battle, camped outside Madina. It was a dark night. The sky was full of clouds. The direction of qiblah could not be correctly ascertained, so they prayed the isha salat after making approximation, which was proved to be wrong in the morning. In Madina, they informed the Holy Prophet of that which had happened and, mindful of their mistake, prayed the said salat again. This verse was then revealed to console those faithful devotees.\"\n(Tafsir Kabir).\nTawalla (to turn) means, in this verse, that in whichever direction the Muslims turn they will win victory, or whichever direction the infidels choose to flee, they will encounter the might of Allah.\n"

Therefore the use of the term \"son\" or \"daughter\" of Allah, as a doctrine or as a metaphor, has been condemned as the greatest sin (Luqman: 13).\nWhen everything in the heavens and the earth and in between them is the creation of Allah, it becomes meaningless to believe that anything, in any sense, can be equal to Him.

It is also true that the belief, generated by a miracle, deprives the individual of the possibility of enjoying the real value of the faith acquired through reason and conviction. The demand for miracles (as stated in verses 90 to 93 of Bani Israil) was made to satisfy the lust for witnessing wonders. It was not the true mission of the last prophet of Allah to satisfy the vain desires of the people who merely wanted to watch and enjoy miracles, The signs of Allah are enough for those who are sure. Likewise when prophet Isa was brought before Herod to perform a miracle, he, who had already performed a large number of miracles and whose very birth was the greatest miracle ever witnessed, refused to comply with the request.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:124]\nThis verse guides mankind to identify the genuine leaders of the true faith as well as the impostors. It also helps to understand risalat and imamat.\nThe covenant was made with Ibrahim, the father of Isma-il as well as Is-haq, long before either of the sons was born.\nThe Lord said to Abraham, \"I will make you into a great nation, l will bless you and make your name so great that it shall be used in blessings:\nThose that bless you I will bless,\nthose that curse you, I will execrate.\nAll the families on earth will pray to be blessed as you are blessed.\"\nThere the Lord appeared to Abraham and said\", I give this land to your descendants.\" So Abraham built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him. (Genesis 12: 2,3, and 7)\nAllah chose Hajirah to bear the first child of Ibrahim and named him Isma-il.\nThe angel of the Lord said to her (Hagar), \"Go back to your mistress and submit to her ill-treatment \".\nThe angel also said:\n\"I will make your descendants too many to be counted.\"\nAnd the angel of the Lord said to her:\n\"You are with child and will bear a son. You shall name him Ishmael, because the Lord has heard of your ill-treatment.\"\n(Genesis 16: 9 to 11)\nImmediately after the birth of Isma-il, Allah made a covenant with Ibrahim. Is-haq was not born at that time.\n\"Live always in my presence and be perfect, so that I may set my covenant between myself and you and multiply your descendants\".\nAbraham threw himself down on his face, and God spoke with him and said, \"I make this covenant, and I make it with you: You shall be the father of a host of nations\". \"I will fulfil my covenant between myself and you and your descendants after you, generation after generation, an everlasting covenant, to be your God, yours and your descendants' after you.\"\n(Genesis 17: 2, 3, 4 and 7)\nAllah further blessed Isma-il with twelve princes in his progeny.\n\"I have heard your prayer for Isma-il. I have blessed him and will make him fruitful. I will multiply his descendants; he shall be father of twelve princes, and I will raise a great nation from him.\" (Genesis 17: 20)\nThe covenant was made with Ibrahim and not with Is-haq, a fact which the Jews overlook when they claim that the promised prophet (Deut 18: 18) should be a Jew.\nAccording to Genesis 17: 7 the covenant was between Allah and Ibrahim and his descendants, generation after generation, when Isma-il was born, so it is logical to say that it pertains to the children of Isma-il, not the children of Is-haq who was born much after this covenant. Again, after the prophecy of the birth of Is-haq when Ibrahim showed concern about Isma-il, this covenant was renewed (Genesis 17: 20), with added blessings - the Twelve Princes in the progeny of Isma-il. It differs with the covenant made with Ibrahim which includes both of his sons, Isma-il and Is-haq, and their descendants:\nThis is how you shall keep my covenant between myself and you and your descendants after\nyou: circumcise yourselves, every male among you. (Genesis 1 7: 1 0)\nI will give you and your descendants after you the land in which you now are aliens, all the land of Canaan, and I will be God to your descendants. (Genesis 17: 8)\nCircumcision is obligatory for the Jews as well as the Muslims. The descendants of Ibrahim had the right to possess the land of Canaan but as the children of Is-haq, the Jews and the Christians, had corrupted the true faith of Ibrahim, the children of Isma-il thus became the rightful owners. In fact after the advent of the Holy Prophet, the true representative of the house of Isma-il, according to Deut: 18 : 18, all the Jews and the Christians should have embraced Islam, the religion of Allah, which Ibrahim had followed. Ibrahim was a prophet. In spite of his holding the office of the prophethood he was tested and tried by Allah before He made him an Imam. It means that a prophet is not necessarily an Imam and imamat is an office of a decidedly higher order which is granted only when one proves himself suitable and worthy after undergoing a test. \"Verily, I make you an Imam for mankind\" clearly indicates that like risalat, imamat is also bestowed upon the chosen representatives of Allah by Allah Himself. It is a position no one, however virtuous or godly he may be, not even Ibrahim, the prophet of Allah, could claim for himself, nor can it be conferred on any one by any individual, group or community. It is an exclusively divine action.\nWhat was the nature of the test which Ibrahim passed to qualify himself for the imamat? To test a prophet of Allah of the calibre of Khalilullah in the elementary matters of personal cleanliness and ethics, as some commentators say, sounds meaningless. It was not an ordinary test, definitely not connected with daily habits, behavioural patterns and acts of personal cleanliness. The word kalimat has been used here in the same sense invested in verse 37 of this surah-Allah turned to Adam mercifully when he received the kalimat from his Lord. See commentary of verse 37 of this surah.\nIbrahim's trial was a test of the steadfastness of his faith in Allah. In his dream prophet Ibrahim received the command of Allah to slay his son, Isma-il. Awake, he at once carried out the command (Saffat: 105 to 108). His faith in Allah was on trial. He was certain that what he saw in his dream was the command of Allah. Allah made him an Imam of mankind, yet he had no right to hand over the office of imamat to his descendants, therefore, he requested Allah to let his descendants inherit it. He could only pray for it, which he did. And it is Allah who alone has the right to appoint an Imam. \"My covenant does not include the zalim (unjust)\" indicates that imamat is given only to those who have not sinned. Only an infallible can be an Imam. Like Ibrahim, Imam Husayn, his descendant, readily sacrificed his sons in the way of Allah.\nZalim (unjust) in the view of the Quran, is he who worships, or has worshipped a ghayrallah. Shirk (idolatry) in the words of the Quran is the greatest zulm or injustice. Therefore he who, at any time in his life, has been a mushrik (idolater) can never be an Imam. Besides the Holy Prophet there was no one, among his companions, who had not been an idol-worshipper, save his cousin, Ali ibna abi Talib, who alone could be rightfully chosen by providence \"to receive the covenant of imamat\". The Holy Prophet, therefore, under the command of Allah transferred the imamat to Ali, and after Ali to the eleven Imams in the progeny of Muhammad and Ali. In this way the covenant of Allah with Ibrahim was fulfilled, and in the progeny of Isma-il the twelve princes, the twelve holy Imams, were born.\nIsmat (infallibility) required for imamat applies to purity from all kinds of sins, great or small, hidden or open, because the conduct of an individual is the outcome of his inherent character and in-built discipline. Therefore, it is downright hypocrisy to accept any man of questionable character as an Imam, arguing that hidden sinfulness should be left alone, and only outward justice should be taken into consideration. Those who have sinned but turned repentant to Allah and gave up sinning can not claim infallibility. Firstly, no one knows for sure that his sins have been forgiven by the Lord. Secondly, repentance may bring forgiveness but the term sinner can never be removed from the name of the person who has sinned. He will be called a forgiven or pardoned sinner. He cannot be equal to a man who has never sinned at all at any time in his life, like Ibrahim. The covenant made with an infallible prophet (Ibrahim) can only be fulfilled by giving imamat to those who are, inwardly and outwardly, as pure and infallible as the great prophet Ibrahim was.\nThe work of legislation was ended with the ministry of the Holy Prophet. Through the last messenger of Allah, the perfected and completed religion of Allah was conveyed to mankind for their material welfare and spiritual progress for all times till the end of the world; yet the mercy of the Lord must continue because an everlasting covenant was made with Ibrahim:\nI will fulfil my covenant between myself and you and your descendants after you, generation after generation, an everlasting covenant. (Genesis 17: 7)\nTherefore there must be an infallible Imam, a divinely commissioned guide, with power and authority delegated to him by Allah, in every age, to keep the people on the right path and direct them unto the destination determined by the merciful Lord of the worlds.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\nWhoever dies, not knowing the Imam of his age, dies in ignorance.\nAllah made Ibrahim an Imam of mankind. He was neither a ruler nor a political force, yet it was made obligatory on mankind to obey him in all temporal as well as spiritual matters, and after him, to obey those of his descendants who have been chosen as Imams. Therefore it is the duty of all Muslims to obey and follow the Imam of the age in all matters, because, as in the case of Ibrahim, political or temporal power is not necessary for an Imam in order to demand obedience from the people.\nThe office of imamat is not hereditary. It is Allah's covenant, which is only bestowed upon an infallible devotee of Allah who comes out successful from the tests and trials specifically prescribed for him by Allah. A sinner or a forgiven sinner cannot be an Imam. The names of the twelve Imams, the descendants of Ibrahim in the progeny of Isma-il, divinely commissioned in fulfilment of the covenant made with Ibrahim, are given below:\n(According to verse 33 of Ali Imran, Allah chose and preferred Adam and Nuh and the descendants of Ibrahim and the descendants of Imran above all His creatures. The requisite merits were known to Allah only but whosoever was chosen had to undergo an evident test or trial. After Ibrahim the lineage was divided into two branches. The lineage Is-haq terminated in Isa who was raised to heavens. The descendants of Isma-il carried the light to Abdul Muttalib. Again it was bifurcated through his two sons - Abdullah, the father of Muhammad al Mustafa, and Abu Talib, the father of Ali al Murtada. Muhammad and Ali were identical with each other in spirit, character and wisdom. One reflected the other. This identity and unity was integrated in one entity through the marriage of Ali and Fatimah, the holy daughter the Holy Prophet.)\n1 Ali al Murtada.\n2 Hasan al Mujtaba-the elder son of Ali and Fatima.\n3 Husayn al Shahid ul Shuhada-the younger son of Ali and Fatimah.\n4 Ali bin Husayn al Zayn al Abidin.\n5 Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir.\n6 Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq.\n7 Musa bin Jafar al Kazim.\n8 Ali bin Musa al Riza.\n9 Muhammad bin Ali al Taqi.\n10 Ali bin Muhammad al Naqi.\n11 Hasan bin Ali al Askari.\n12 Muhammad bin Hasan al Mahdi.\n(Imam Muhammad al Mahdi is alive like Khizr and Isa. He is the living Imam, for all times till the end of the world. He is the awaited saviour. At the appointed time he will appear in order to exercise the divine authority. Along with him Isa will also come back on the earth and follow the leadership of Imam al Mahdi, as Ali had followed the Holy Prophet. In this way the bifurcated descendants of Ibrahim will be reunited.)\nAll the above mentioned Imams were infallible from birth to their martyrdom and never received any formal education or training at the hands of any mortal, yet were the fountainheads of knowledge, wisdom and guidance.\nThe merit for selection to the divine office of nubuwwat, risalat, imamat, or khilafat is the degree of submission to the divine will and the ability to reflect (or to convey) the same to others, the measure of perfection which determines the state of nearness to the absolute. The test (ibtila) is the theoretical and functional knowledge of the kalimat (the most comprehensive names) on account of which Adam was given the khilafatullah (vicegerency of Allah). These kalimat are accommodated in the essence of Muhammad and Ali Muhammad. They are the manifestation of the light of the kalimat appeared before Adam for the first time.\n"

It was in ruins. Ibrahim rebuilt it. As verse 127 of this surah suggests, after purification, the place was reserved for worship of Allah only.

She had a handmaid whose name was Hajirah. She gave her to Ibrahim as a wife. Hajirah bore Ibrahim a son. Ibrahim named the child Ismail. After his birth, the peace and harmony of the family was disturbed. Sarah ill-treated Hajirah. Ibrahim was vexed on Ismail's account. He sought Allah's help. Allah, in view of Sarah's past goodness, directed Ibrahim to send away Hajirah and Ismail to a place now called Makka. Ibrahim, with the help of Jibrail, took Hajirah and Ismail out of the native land and reached Arabia. They stopped at the place where hajar aswad or the black stone is stationed. Jibrail informed Ibrahim that it was a land full of Allah's blessings and bounties, and there used to be a house (known as baytul mamur) in that place, which was held sacred and venerated by mankind in ancient times, and that it was Allah's will that Ibrahim and Ismail should rebuild the ruined house again. A shelter was made for Hajirah and Ismail so that they could live there in Ibrahim's absence because Allah had commanded Ibrahim to go back to his native land. At the time of his departure Hajirah said:\n\"O Ibrahim, the devotee of Allah, in whose care are you leaving us here?\"\nIbrahim said:\n\"I leave you in the care of Allah who saved me from the fire in which Namrud threw me, and gave me all that which I needed and desired.\"\nHajirah said:\n\"I rely upon Allah. He is sufficient for me and my child.\"\nWhen Ibrahim reached the mount Zi-Tavi, he stopped and turned towards the place where he left Hajirah and Ismail and prayed:\n\"Our Lord! Verily I have settled a part of my progeny in a barren valley near to Thy holy house, our Lord. so that they may establish prayer; so incline some hearts of men that they yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits in order that they may be grateful.\" (IBRAHIM: 37)\nWhen the water in the waterskin, Ibrahim left for them, was finished, there was no water any where near them to quench their thirst. There was no milk in her breasts. The heat in the desert had dried it. The scorching sun brought the situation from bad to worse. The child was restless. He cried, cried and cried. The mother ran hither and thither, between Safa and Marwa.\nFrom Safa to Marwa and Marwa to Safa she ran seven times because when she was on the mount of Safa she heard a voice from the mount of Marwa, and when she reached Marwa she heard a voice from Safa. There was no one in sight. Unable to see her son dying, she left him where he was lying and stood alone on the mount of Marwa. Dejected, helpless, yet worried for her son she came back. There she saw a spring of fresh and sweet water gushing forth from the earth under the feet of Ismail. In her absence Jibrail, under the command of Allah, came and produced a well full of water (known as Zamzam) - also recorded in Genesis 21: 14 to 21. She heard a voice (saying):\n\"Fear not. The Lord has produced this well for you and your son, but it will also serve the pilgrims who will visit His holy house which your husband and son shall build.\"\nThe flow of water increased day by day and the surrounding land became fertile. People began to come and settle there. Soon it became a flourishing town. Trade and commerce developed. When Ibrahim returned he found the wasteland in the desert a busy trade centre.\nThe running of Hajirah between Safa and Marwa has been prescribed as one of the essential rites of hajj.\n"

According to Imam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq \"Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together\" gives glad tidings to the true believers that wherever they may be, at the time of the zahur (reappearance) of the living Imam, they will be brought together under his banner. Many Muslim commentators say that this refers to the day of judgement. It is a meaningless interpretation because in this verse only the believers are addressed and not the whole of mankind, comprising believers and disbelievers, who will be summoned on the day of judgement for final examination and retribution.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAs has already been pointed out in the commentary of verse 115 of this surah, specific direction does not mean that manifestation of Allah is restricted to that direction only. He is manifest in all directions. The order to turn to a particular direction, while praying, was a test of obedience for the followers of the faith as mentioned in verse 143 of this surah, and also to create unity of purpose in the minds of the praying believers.\nEvery one has a direction in life, the ultimate object of which is Allah. As mentioned in verse 177 of this surah performing good deeds in the overall interest of the society (to possess the theoretical and functional virtues, the root of which is faith in Allah - Tawhid) minimises the importance of the turning towards the east or the west as a virtue.\nHuwa (He) is generally translated to mean \"everyone\" (kul), but the Shia grammarians assert that it refers to Allah.\nMuwalliha is also recited as muwallaha. Muwallaha, past participle, means He is the ultimate object of the direction of every one 's mind. Muwalliha, present participle, means He is directing everyone towards a particular direction, as has been said in verse 48 of al Ma-idah. The purpose of various precepts and methods of worship is to test competitive striving for owning virtues. Notwithstanding the different directions of striving, every man will reach the same destination. The absolute is all pervasive. The Holy Prophet said: \"Do not abuse nature which some people take as the first cause of the whole phenomenon. Nature itself is God\". But a person who perceives or identifies Him in the manifestations of nature can not be equal to the man who reaches the highest stage of monotheistic belief. Therefore, it is not proper to say that all religions are true because their aim is one and the same. The difference in realisation of the truth distinguishes which one is the best direction. The Quran refers to the different directions and makes clear the best direction.\n"

Sale's interpretation of fisabilillah (wars fought against non-Muslims to propagate Islam) is a deliberate distortion. There is no compulsion in religion (Baqarah: 256), therefore, the Holy Prophet went to war only when it was forced upon him.\nAll the created beings are given the opportunity to prove their potential, therefore, everyone is tried with something of fear, hunger, and loss of possessions and children. Those who have attained the highest spiritual maturity through personal virtues, ability to exercise patience, with faith and reliance upon Allah, face the trials successfully and reach the highest stations nearest to Allah. Each individual occupies a different status according to the degree of faith and patience he employs to encounter the test and trial. Some souls are not considered fit to be tried. It is their misfortune. The exemption may be to let their infidelity or hypocrisy grow to its full scope for which there is a painful punishment. (Ali Imran: 178).\nThe Holy Prophet and the twelve holy Imams occupy the highest status near Allah with reference to the faith in and reliance upon Allah, personal virtues and ability to exercise patience. For the cause of truth, in the way of Allah, they gladly suffered every kind of misery, hardship and calamity of the utmost severity throughout their lives. Only once in the history of the world all kinds of trials, mentioned in this verse (155), to the maximum conceivable degree, have been happily and triumphantly endured and coped with by Imam Husayn and his family and friends in the desert of Karbala. No less was the situation of the other holy Imams under the tyrannical rule of the Ummawi and Abbasi rulers.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe soul of every conscious being will taste death (Ali Imran: 185), therefore, this verse does not refer to the departure of the soul from the body. It refers to a particular state of blissful life which the souls of the non-Muslims are deprived of.\nThe term \"life\" and \"death\" has also been used in the Quran to signify \"knowledge\" and \"ignorance\" (Ya Sin: 70), or \"belief\" and \"disbelief\" (An-am: 123) respectively.\nThe life the soul lives after its departure from the body can be termed as death if it is more painful and miserable than the life of this world when it was in the body, because it has been deprived of the bliss it enjoyed here. And if the life of the hereafter is more blissful than here, the life of this world should be described as death.\nThe Holy Prophet has rightly observed:\nThis world is a prison for the believer and a paradise for the disbeliever.\nA poor Jew once asked Imam Hasan to tell him how could his poverty be a paradise and Imam's plenty be a prison?\nThe Imam replied:\n\"If you would know the miseries awaiting the disbelievers, and the blessings in store for the believers in the life of hereafter, you will then agree that even your present plight is a paradise compared to those miseries, and my affluence here is a prison for me as compared to the blessings that will be bestowed on me there.\"\nLife and death should be understood in the sense of gain and loss in the various stages man passes through, as described by the Quran in verse 154 of this surah. In verse 169 of Ali Imran it is advised not to think that those who are slain in the way of Allah are dead, because they are alive, getting sustenance from their Lord. It means that they are in direct communion with their cherisher and sustainer. The term shahid, in the Quran, refers to this state of existence.\n"

The \"unity of God\" is the main and single fundamental upon which the whole structure of the religion of Islam rests, through which all guidance and enlightenment emerge.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe word wahid (one) is not used in any numerical sense, nor in the sense of order (the first of any second), nor in the sense of the oneness of a genus or a specie, nor in any other general term, but it is used in the sense that He is indivisible, unanalysable organically, chemically, geometrically, logically, mentally or physically, or in any sense whatsoever. This unity, in essence, does not correspond to any limitation. Since He is unlimited, a second, an equal, or an opposite to Him is not conceivable.\nIbna Babwah writes in the book of Tawhid:\nIn the battle of Jamal a Bedouin asked Ali:\n\"Do you say that God is One?\"\nSome companions did not like the idea of asking such a question at a time when Ali was fighting a war, and they rebuked him.\nBut Ali ibna abi Talib said:\n\"Do not disapprove his question, because what he asks is the very object of this battle. We are demanding the true answer to this question (same faith in the unity of Allah) from our enemy.\" Then Ali gave the above-noted description of Tawhid.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:164]\nHaving said that there is only one God, the e creation and its duality is described. Nature's diversity is caused by one source and it will revert to the same source. There are heavens and earth, day and night, land and sea, dryness and wetness, life and death; and man, who is the highest form of creation, is given the consciousness to experience all of these, to explore the meaning behind them. Whoever contemplates on the nature of creation, will reach the conclusion that it is one divine power that activates and enlivens all the diverse manifestations.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe harmony in the working of the universe is referred to in the Quran as a sign of the unity of the maker. Man is asked to reflect over this creation and realise the divine unity in the midst of diversity and amongst the various forces of nature that work in perfect harmony. (See quotation from Nahj al Balagha on page 20).\nAs has been pointed out by Imam Musa bin Jafar al Kazim to his disciple, Hisham bin Hakam: Verily Allah perfected His arguments with reasoning, assisted His messengers with miracles, and proved His rububiyat with His signs.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq has explained the part reasoning plays in determining the relationship between man and God and its limitations. Reasoning (the internal) and the prophet (the external) are the two proofs Allah puts forward to let the people, who understand, have unshakeable faith in Allah. There is no use of the external proof (the prophet) if the heart and mind are not convinced through the internal proof (the reasoning). There may be religious doctrines beyond the grasp of limited human intellect but there should be no religious assertion contradictory to rational thinking. This shows that the only medium for understanding the absolute and securing nearness to Allah is sound logical reasoning. After reaching the final stage of the realisation of His existence and unity, the medium between him and the absolute becomes the divine revelation.\n( 165)\nTo love, adore and worship a ghayrallah (other-than-Allah) is bound to bring about punishment .\nThe Arabic phrase ka-hubbillah means the love of idol-worshippers for their idols and their leaders which should have been for Allah. This also refers to the followers of the false and self-appointed leaders among the Muslims who usurped authority to keep them away from the true divinely commissioned rightly guided religious leaders. Those believers who are stronger in love for Allah not only love everything that Allah loves but also love the true leaders of the religion of Allah because they love to love that which Allah loves in order to please Allah. Therefore the followers of Muhammad and Ali Muhammad love or hate anything or anyone for the sake and in the cause of Allah\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:178]\nIn this verse the law of qisas (requital, settlement) is set forth in detail. It is enforceable strictly according to the demands of justice tempered with the spirit of mercy. Allah is the forgiving, and therefore man must be able to forgive. The heirs of the slain have the choice to pardon the murderer if someone on behalf of him pays them the blood-price, after which brotherhood is again restored among the parties concerned. Before the advent of Islam, more often than not, the scenario after a murder was a chain of brutal and bloodthirsty reactions. The families and the tribes of both the slayer and the slain used to engage themselves into a war of attrition, generation after generation, involving innocent men, women and children. Islam, through the Holy Prophet, put a stop to this barbaric collective human behaviour and gave a just and kind system of justice to the human race, which for the first time, without ignorance and superstition, applied compassion and understanding in order to live in peace and harmony. \"Payment should be made according to recognised usage in a good manner\" is called diyat (blood-money). In the end this verse says that moderation in punishment is an alleviation from the Lord. Verse 92 of al Nisa prescribes moderation when the murder is not premeditated and intentional. Verse 93 of al Nisa clearly declares that a great punishment awaits the murderer who kills a believer intentionally. In addition to the legal penalty, in the hereafter, he will abide in hell for ever.\nVerse 9 of al Hujurat says that if two groups of believers fight one another, promote peace between them. Then if one of them turns aggressive against the other, fight against the aggressive party till it returns to Allah's authority. If it does so, make peace among them equitably and be impartial.\nCompare these practical ways of ensuring peace and harmony among the conflicting forces, a regular and day-to-day phenomenon in the human society, with the imaginary, decorative and unreasonable slogans introduced by the Christian Church:\n\"When a man hits you on the cheek, offer him the other cheek too; when a man takes your coat, let him have your shirt as well. Give to every one who asks you; when a man takes what is yours; do not demand it back.\" (Luke 6: 29 and 30)\nAt no time in history the Christian or any other authority could put this principle into practice.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nMa-ruf means anything known, recognised, approved, and according to customary usage. Its opposite is munkar - rejected, disapproved and contrary to common sense and religious laws.\nIn matters pertaining to the relatives, charity and maintenance of widows or divorced wives, ma-ruf means moderation in the light of common sense. In the case of amr bil ma-ruf it means obligatory duties prescribed by Islam. In Nahya anil munkar, munkar means forbidden prohibitions.\n"

The proper justice of retaliation is discrimination without which we become transgressors by not enforcing Allah's law of balance. Therefore, the guilty should be paid back in the same coin. The people against whom the crime is committed should know what punishment has been given and how it is carried out.

Khayr according to most commentators means abundant wealth or large property.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAlthough the Sunni school thinks that this verse has been abrogated by verse 11 of al Nisa, but its proper study makes it clear that the distribution of wealth among the heirs is to be effected after taking the will (bequest) of the deceased into consideration. The Holy Prophet and Imam Ali had clearly, in many instances, advised those, who sought their guidance, to bequeath or not to bequeath according to the merits and circumstances of the seekers of guidance. Here the word kutiba means \"laid down\". It can be compulsory or optional according to the merits and circumstances of the case.\nTo alter or to misinterpret the word of Allah is a major sin. Beware. He is hearing, knowing. The wishes of a departed being should not be altered.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:183]\nFasting is a means of restraining and controlling the nafs, so that contentment (rida), and all the other blessings of this great discipline may be experienced. The fasting of the ordinary man is to withhold only from food and drink. The fasting of the pious man is to curb sensory desires, to refrain from looking at the unlawful, hearing the harmful, and thinking about the distasteful, or about what stimulates the lower nature. The fasting of a true believer is to seal the heart from paying any attention to other-than-Allah (ghayrallah), and safeguard himself with thorough awareness of the divine laws. Fasting (sawm) is one of the obligatory functions of the faith, next only to the prescribed 5 times a day prayers (salat), in importance. It trains the Muslims to guard themselves against evil as well as conditions them to suffer physical affliction and exercise self control in the defence of faith and the faithful.\nFasting, although not as perfectly regulated and decisive as in Islam, was prescribed for the followers of the previous prophets also, and was also in vogue, in varying forms, in different parts of the world. Among the Jews it was done in times of sorrow and affliction. Among the Hindus in India, fasting is undertaken as a penance or to achieve spiritual power. The Sabians were also prescribed fasting for one full month and the object of fasting among them was almost identical to Islamic fasting.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThis verse is wrongly stated to be abrogated by the next verse, which, in fact, deals with some of the details of the conditions to be observed during the fasting.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:184]\nFasting is prescribed \"for a certain number of days\" - and as per the next verse they are the days of the month of Ramadan. The deeper benefits of fasting are gained when one is in good health. However, both in sickness and travel, these benefits are unlikely to be realised, therefore, exemption from fasting is provided, but a number of other days should be selected to fast in lieu of the obligatory fasts that have not been observed due to sickness or travel, and also a redemption (fidyah) should be effected by feeding a poor man for every missed fast. Aged people, nursing mothers and other cases in which the health is sure to be harmed by fasting can forego fasting altogether, but feed the poor instead, giving away the equivalent of one man's food daily for each fast missed.\nIt is better to fast as well as feed the poor to obtain a greater return from Allah. The fidyah is a concession allowed to the sick and the old but if they know the deeper benefits of fasting they must fast instead of availing the concession. The Holy Prophet and the holy Imams used to give away whatever they had in the way of Allah but in the month of Ramadan, they were more liberal and open-handed, because the month of Ramadan is the month of Allah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nYutiquna means the ability to do something with great difficulty. The old and the sick come in this category. It is unreasonable to say that \"so whoever witness this month (Ramadan) shall fast in it\" (see next verse) cancels this passage. According to the holy Ahl ul Bayt this passage has not been abrogated. Tawaqa means ability with hardship, and tawa-a means ability with ease. This subtle difference was pointed out by Imam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq. This passage applies to those who are able to fast but due to some weakness it is very difficult for them to do so.\n"

Bayt ul ma-mur is said to be the celestial counterpart of the holy Kabah. It is an allegorical term used for the heart of the Holy Prophet.

Allah hears every cry of help and gives to His devotee that which is best in his interest, known to His infinite wisdom alone. Acceptance of prayer does not mean immediate fulfilment of whatever is sought.\n\"So they should answer My call\" means man should carry out Allah's will expressed through His commandments to regulate and discipline the life of this world.\n\"And believe in Me\" means awareness of the ever-living presence of the almighty and all-knowing Lord creator, equal to or like unto whom is no one.\nTo get that which is desired man has to make efforts and employ all the means at his disposal, arranged and provided by Allah, and then invoke Him to let the labour bear fruit. To use the available means properly, to apply the native faculties, and to pay close attention he needs guidance for which he invokes the highest authorities from whom nothing is hidden and for whom nothing is impossible. Through prayers guidance is received as to how the efforts should be made to fulfil the desires. The merciful Lord who is also all-wise knows what is profitable (An-am: 41). Sometimes Allah puts His devoted servants to test and trial (Baqarah: 155). In this sense man's efforts and his prayers are inseparable.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe act of invocation has been recommended by Allah Himself, because it helps to make the efforts of man fruitful. This passage dismisses the fatalist view that man's destiny is predetermined, regardless of his actions; this verse not only recommends prayer but also promises a response, showing that prayer which is a human action, has its effect on determining the destiny. The prayer to which response is promised should be a sincere cry from the depth of the heart. If there is predestination as the fatalists say, then this verse and verse 5 of Al Fatihah become meaningless. Please refer to the commentary of al Fatihah: 5.\nImam Ali ibna abi Talib says:\nPut faith in Allah. Seek His protection.\nDirect your prayers, requests, solicitations and supplications to Him and Him alone.\nTo give as well as to withhold lies in His (only in His) power.\nAsk as much of His favours as you can.\nKnow that Allah owns the treasures of the heavens and the earth. Not only He has given permission to ask for His mercy and favours, but also has promised to listen to your prayers. He has not appointed guards to prevent your prayers reaching Him. Invoke His help in difficulties and distress. Implore Him to grant you long life and sound health. Pray to Him for prosperity.\nThink over it that by simply granting you the privilege of praying for His favours and mercy, He has handed over the keys of His treasures to you. Whenever you are in need, pray, and He gives His favours and blessings.\nSometimes you find requests are not immediately granted. Do not be disappointed. Fulfilment of desires rests with the true purpose or intention of the pray-er. More often fulfilment is delayed because the merciful Lord wants to bestow upon you suitable rewards. In the meantime bear patiently hardships, believing sincerely in His help. You will get better favours, because, unknowingly, you may ask for things which are really harmful to you. Many of your requests, if granted, may bring eternal damnation.\nSo, at times, withholding fulfilment is a blessing in disguise.\n"

The reasons are given below:\n(1) Even an illiterate person can determine the day of the month and the month of the year according to the different shapes and forms of the moon, which cannot be calculated from the sun.\n(2) Man can experience the joy and satisfaction of fulfilment in every type of season, which is not possible if solar calendar is followed.\n(3) Acts of worship do not become seasonal rituals.\n(4) The lunar year is shorter than the solar year. So the devotee gets more opportunities, in his lifetime, to turn to Allah, and obtain more benefits.\nThe inclination of some to adopt the solar calendar, with reference to acts of worship, under the influence of Christian propaganda, should be discouraged, because it was Paul, who, in order to please the pagan Romans, introduced the solar calendar.\nOn account of superstitious customs before Islam, the Arabs, after putting the 'Ihram' did not enter their houses through the regular doors, but made new back entrances to get into their abodes. This verse put an end to this false belief.\nThe true interpretation of this verse is that every occasion has its own door of approach. Every arena, physical, intellectual, or spiritual, has its natural point of entry. The intelligent man recognises the right door, unsuperstitiously, and in order to enter depends on knowledge. Entering from behind is a figurative expression for rejecting the right course, and entering through the (regular) door means following the right path. The house is the \"house of guidance\". Righteousness is this that one should approach the \"house of guidance\" through its door, the right path. \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\", said the Holy Prophet. To know the true guidance one has to turn to Ali as the Shia school (Islam original) rightly does. The Mutazali sect of Sunni school and the sufis also follow the teachings of Imam Ali ibna abi Talib.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:190]\nThe message of Islam is universal. From early times the Muslims were only permitted to fight in self defence. When there is no option, and in the face of persecution, however, the Muslims must fight. The strength of Islam lies in its certainty of ultimate victory over aggression, transgression, and ascribing falsehood to Allah and His last prophet. Fitna can mean oppression, persecution, seduction - all implying the \"discord\" that attachment with ghayrallah (other-than-Allah) brings about. It is used as in verse 217 of this surah - war is detestable but fitna is worse than slaughter. Islam promotes peace, order and harmony in the human society and keeps man on the right path. When the enemies of Islam found that the light of this message was sweeping darkness from every corner, the disbelievers vowed to annihilate it. It was only then that, no recourse being left for the believers, they had to resolutely take up the sword in defence. Verses 39 and 40 of al Hajj also give permission to fight when any people is wronged, oppressed and persecuted.\nIf Numbers 25: 1 to 3 and 31: 7 to 18 in the Old Testament are read carefully one comes to the conclusion that when the Israelites, in Shitim, began to worship the gods of Moab the Lord God asked Moses to \"take all the leaders of the people and hurl them down to their death before the Lord.\"\nAnd they made war on Midians as the Lord has commanded Moses, and slew all the men. The Israelites took captive the Madianite women and children, and carried off all their cattle, their flocks and their property. They burnt all their cities. Moses asked them to kill every male child and every women who has had intercourse with a man.\nSo in the way of Allah, the prophets were commanded to put an end to the activities of the disbelievers who wanted to destroy the true devotees of Allah in order to stop the advancement and progress of the religion of Allah. The Quran commands the Muslims not to exceed the limits but to fight evil until its power base is dislodged, and if the kafirs desist then to show mercy. Compared to what the other prophets did, as commanded by Allah, to destroy the unbelievers, the role assigned to the Holy Prophet as the \"mercy unto the worlds\" was the most benign of all the campaigns undertaken by His messengers to liberate mankind from the clutches of the enemies of Allah. He fought and killed the enemy whenever war was imposed on him.\nNobody who has any idea of the miserable conditions of the early Muslims, would for a moment imagine that this handful of people could have wantonly set themselves to provoke the active hostility of the whole world about them. They would quietly have borne any provocation rather than take the risk of fighting numberless hordes. If they did engage themselves in this way, one would presume that circumstances had forced them to it; unless their very existence was in peril, they could not possibly have thought to plunge themselves into a mortal struggle. This is so clear a priori that even if the initiative did appear to be taken by Muslims, no sane minded person would for a moment suppose that they were really offensive wars - they must have been offensive with a defensive import. The circumstances had forced them to take action, and if the Holy Prophet had not been quick to it and had waited for a formal assault from the other side, he would only have given the enemy time to collect their forces; and who can doubt that in that case, the world would soon have heard the last of this little band of Muslims.\nYet such is the perversity of prejudice that no such considerations, obvious as they are, are allowed to have any weight with writers like Muir, Sale, Neoldeke and others. All they can see is that in the battle of Badr and its prelude, the raid of Abdullah bin Jahsh, it was the Muslims that began the quarrel with the infidels. What the infidels had been doing all the time before is, as a matter of principle, ignored and forgotten.\nHow deep-rooted was the acrimony which drove the infidels on against the new converts, may be easily judged from their pursuing them down even to Abyssinia, to where the Muslims had fled to avoid the horrible tortures they were suffering at their hands. The infidels would not let them live in peace even in other lands. Could it be imagined that they could all complacently see them flourish and develop their mission from a centre only 70 miles away from themselves? What are the facts? Soon after the emigration of the Holy Prophet, they wrote to the chief of Madina, Abdullah ibna Obay, as follows:\nYou have given protection to our man. We have sworn by God that you either kill him or expel him, otherwise we will come upon you with all of us. and kill your fighting men and take hold of your women as lawful for us\"\nObay bin Kab says, \"When the Holy Prophet and his people came to Madina and the Ansars took them under their protection, all the Arabs were united to make an assault upon them. They never lay down to sleep except with their weapons with them.\"\nThis is not the place to give an account of the various wars and battles that were fought. They will be described under the various verses relating to them.\nThis is merely an introduction that may help us to understand the true state of things at the time. All this is quietly passed over by European critics of Islam.\nFinally it should be noted that as without jihad correspondence of the Holy Prophet to the career of prophet Musa would fail to be perfect, Islam would also fail to be a complete and perfect religion for the world. Fighting has well been said to be the direct necessity of human nature, a religion that did not provide for it, did not regulate its principles and define its rightful limits, would not be a perfect religion, much less a final religion for the world.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn spite of all that has been said that Islam prefers peaceful methods of preaching the truth, and that it never took any initiative in waging wars against its opponents, the fact is that Islam recognises the right of taking the initiative in using force against those who persist in ungodly activities causing human degradation or social and moral deterioration. But this measure can only be adopted by the prophet of Allah or his vicegerents, authorised by Him, and none else. As Imam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir says: \"A war may be termed as holy or godly (jihad) if the object is to make people give up submission to the ghayrallah and to submit only to Allah's authority and the divine will. But if the purpose is to make them give up submission to one creature in order to submit to any other, it is the usual war waged for selfish and worldly gain. Hence it is unholy and thus condemned by Islam.\" Taking this definition in view, it is obvious that no war is holy unless it is sanctioned and allowed by the person who is perfectly pure from every kind of ungodliness and is constantly in communion with the universal will of the absolute.\nHowever, Islam enjoins on Muslims to be always ready, well prepared and well equipped to meet all exigencies, or an eventuality which may unexpectedly develop against them, then they should gather as much strength as they can, so that their opponents, the opponents of the divine cause, may refrain from any unprovoked aggression. (Anfal: 60).\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:191]\nThe order is to kill the enemy (against whom fighting has been enjoined) wherever they are found, whilst the war goes on. It does not refer to unbelievers in general.\n\"And drive them out from where they drove you out\" refers to Makka, wherein the holy Kabah, the centre of Islam, is located, because it belonged to the Muslims but was usurped by the infidels unlawfully.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nFitna means subversive activities to destroy peace and rule of law. With reference to other verses like this verse (Nisa: 135; Ma-idah: 2 and 8) it must be said that Islam advocates universal peace and harmony in the human society and teaches us to tolerate and accommodate other creeds so far as their followers do not hatch plots and generate ill-will to destroy the Muslims and ascribe falsehood to Allah and His religion. In verses 1, 8 and 9 of al Mumtahanah, the believers are advised to show kindness and do justice to the unbelievers who are not hostile to them, but at all events, friendship with the enemies of Allah has been discouraged. Islam avoids killing and destruction, but when public peace and safety is at stake, prompt and severe action is taken to bring order and eliminate lawlessness. Islam has no room for wilful aggressors and cunning mischief-makers. The sanctity of the holy Kabah and the sacred months is very important, but when attacked all considerations should be kept in abeyance till the aggressors are destroyed completely. Keeping this principle in view, the Holy Prophet fought against the infidels of Makka and their (Jewish) associates, in self defence, because they wanted to exterminate the religion of Allah and its followers. When the Syrian vassals of the Roman empire advised Hercules to help and support the Makkan pagans and liquidate the Muslims, the Holy Prophet had to go to war against the Christians. No peaceful person, tribe or community was ever attacked by him. He did not allow his followers, either in his lifetime or after, to needlessly attack any people. There are many traditions and verses of the Quran which enjoin peaceful preaching of the truth through argument and reason, with wisdom and kind exhortation in the best way possible. (Nahl: 125). The sword which was used to defend the cause of Islam right from the beginning was the dhulfiqar, and the man who devoted his life to the cause of Islam was Ali. A divine voice informed the Holy Prophet in the midst of the battle of Uhad.\nLA FATA ILLA ALI, LA SAYF ILLA DHULFIQAR\n(There is no hero save Ali, there is no sword save dhulfiqar)\nAli, the champion of Islam, and his God-sent sword fought against the pagans of Makka and their allies and the Jews and the Christians in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. After him, he never took part in the hostile campaigns directed against the non-Muslims of the world by the companions of the Holy Prophet. It is because of the policies carried out by those companions, that men like Gibbon declared that Islam was preached by the sword, as he (wrongly) concluded that what the followers did, must have been the policy of the preacher. He failed to identify the true followers of the prophet of Islam, Ali and his sons, who, after the Holy Prophet, took the sword in their hands, not to enslave the non-Muslims and appropriate their wealth, but to save Islam from the evil of hypocrisy which had emerged in full force to mutilate the beautiful face of Islam. \"I shall not cease to fight against the hypocrites until the last of them is driven out from the fold of the true believers,\" said Imam Ali ibna abi Talib. In Kerbala Imam Husayn bin Ali used the dhulfiqar for the last time to distinguish between right and wrong or truth and falsehood. When this purpose was served the God-sent sword was sheathed for ever till the return of the last living Imam. The event of Kerbala clearly separated and identified the two camps the camp of Allah and the camp of Shaytan. The Imams in the progeny of Imam Husayn, through piety, reason and wisdom, preached the true religion of Allah. The hypocrisy of the usurpers, through ruthless intimidation and shameless treason, opposed them to crush and destroy the Islam original kept alive by the Ahl ul Bayt. Yet the Islam original flourished. The severest despots could not obliterate it.\n"

The root of evil is in polytheism. It should be uprooted. When our living Imam returns, he will put an end to polytheism and make available true freedom for mankind. In verse 40 of al Hajj it is said that Allah repels some men by means of others to keep safe synagogues, churches and cloisters so that every man may have the freedom to remember God according to his own belief, because there is no compulsion in religion (Baqarah: 256). Only Islam, and no other religion, gives freedom to one and all to worship one true God - Allah.\n\"And if they desist\" means when the polytheists renounce false gods and idol-worshipping and come into the fold of the true faith, Islam, and believe in the one and only true God.\n"

When a man gets what he deserves, proportionate to his deeds, it is called justice (adl); but if one is given more in view of one's needs, more than what one deserves, it is called ihsan (to give for a present).\nIslam views closefisted miserliness as ungodliness, which keeps the miser away from paradise and throws him into hell.\nBy not spending in the way of Allah, individuals cast themselves and their nation into perdition and both are destroyed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nMan's life and his possessions are not his own. They belong to Allah. Man only holds them as a trust. He should not use them to please himself. He must spend of his possessions and readily give his life in the way of Allah to promote His cause, as Imam Husayn did in Kerbala. But he must protect his life and property when there is no danger to the religion or to the mission of Allah, as the Holy Prophet did at the time of the treaty of Hudaybiya, as Ali did in Siffin, and as Hasan did with Mu-awiya.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:196]\nThe date and the month for performing hajj is fixed, whereas umra, an abridged ritual, can be performed at any time.\nTo inculcate restraint, perseverance, sincerity and purity of intention, submission, and dedication to the service of Allah, a thorough discipline has been prescribed for performing hajj and umrah. [Please study \"Hajj and Umrah guide\" and \"Supplications for Hajj and Umrah\", published by the Peermahomed Ebrahim Trust, or any such publication published by the Shia publishing houses.\nHajj is a week of total loyalty. The body is denied all kinds of comforts. The mind and the heart are tuned to bask in the light of devotion. It enables man to rise to the glorious heights of spiritual bliss. The proud, rich and the egotistic celebrities are made to know and realise their true insignificance, otherwise, in any other situation, they would prefer to spend any amount to avoid association with the ordinary people and being brought to the level of the meek . No distinction of wealth, fame, birth, colour or nationality are of any use when the hajj begins. All are in the service of the Lord. It is a training ground to put the idea of the brotherhood of man into practice. Whoso fails to do in day-to-day life what he has experienced during the hajj, is not a true believer. There is no other religion which has such an institution to inspire effective voluntary control to curb brutality and pride, so easily acquired by the men of the world. Islam would have been labelled as an imperfect code of life if hajj has not been prescribed as an obligatory duty.\nThe criticism of the slaughter of animals by the opponents of Islam is unreasonable. Animals have been created by the creator to provide food for the human beings. There is \"life\" in everything man or animal eats or drinks. Therefore saving or sparing \"life\" is not possible. This is the law of nature. The very existence of life depends upon the proper consuming of life. Life in the lower stages of creation has been purposely created to be sacrificed to serve the survival of the species in the higher realm. Similarly, man has been created to sacrifice his self which is dearest to him, to reach the higher realms of divinity or spiritual bliss. It is true that purposeless slaughter of animals is a waste of Allah's bounty when it is carried out in contravention to the laws of the author of nature. Even for those who hold animals sacred, the surest way to show their concern is to slaughter them at the proper time, because one day they will be eliminated by death. So, if an animal is to die anyway, it is better to use it for sustenance of human life, rather than letting it go waste. The merciful creator, therefore, has allowed slaughter of animals for the sustenance of human life.\nIn the days of ignorance, man sacrificed man to please his man-made gods. Islam stopped this practice. Instead, to keep alive the spirit of the intended sacrifice of Ismail by Ibrahim, to show his obedience to his Lord, sacrifice of animals has been prescribed. On the other hand, Islam prohibits purposeless killing of animals. As long as a haji is in ihram he cannot kill even a mosquito. Hunting is not only forbidden during the hajj but also as a sport in ordinary life. Imam Ali, on his death bed, asked his children to take care of the birds he had domesticated, or else to set them free. Once a disciple of Imam Jafar al Sadiq killed some pigeons in exasperation. The Imam asked him to give one dinar in charity for every pigeon he had killed as an expiation.\nThe companions of Imam Hasan tried to make a dog run when the unclean animal came near them while they were having meals with the Imam. The Imam prevented them and began to eat one morsel himself and gave another to the dog. He said: \"I should feel ashamed if a creature of Allah looks at my food and I turn it away.\"\nAt the call of duty a true believer must be ready to act as commanded, therefore, the impracticable and imaginary tenderness, which actually is not so, should not be allowed to take root. One must kill even a human being if proved guilty of murder and lawfully condemned to death. The misconceived feeling of tenderness is a moral weakness which can be removed by proper training.\nIf the holy Kabah is held in reverence, it is not idolatry. The spirit of holding in veneration things dedicated to Allah (or godliness) without any intention of worshipping them, even if it is the psyche of the idol-worshippers, is not idolatry. The holy edifice was built by Ibrahim and Ismail, the two distinguished friends of Allah, for the exclusive remembrance of the true Lord. The pagans appropriated it and used it as their temple. The two other friends of Allah, the Holy Prophet and Imam Ali, cleared the sacred house of the idols and restored it to its original purpose. They destroyed the false gods but retained the really venerable black stone used by Ibrahim in construction of the holy house, because this stone was sent down by Allah. Likewise the respect paid to Safa and Marwa, on account of its association with Ibrahim and Ismail, has been preserved.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"Whoever profits by combining umrah with hajj means that after performing umrah, the\npilgrim casts off ihram and puts it on again at the time of hajj, but by combining umrah with hajj he does not have to journey again for hajj after umrah, and also does not have to be in ihram all the time during the intervening period. The second caliph, nominated by the first caliph, who opposed this in the life time of the holy Prophet, issued orders to discontinue it and muta ul nisa, and hayya ala khayril amal from the azan. However, the later jurists did not follow his order for discontinuation of the muta ul hajj but the muta ul nisa and hayya ala khayril amal had been discontinued by the ignorant people in contravention of the divine commandments (Nisa: 24).\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:197]\nShawwal, Dhilqad and Dhilhajj are the well known months. One can start the pilgrimage in these months but the principal performance of hajj has been prescribed in the month of Dhilhajj. During these days the pilgrim enters the state of purity in which he is entirely absorbed with Allah. Taqwa is the best provision, because by resigning oneself to Allah and abstaining from all that which connects with worldly matters, devotion to Allah becomes total. Everything which pertains to rafas (sexual intercourse), fasaq (fornication), jidal (quarrelling with one another) are forbidden.\n\"Take provision\" means to plan and carry sufficient provisions for the journey so as not to be a burden on others. Some people used to go for pilgrimage to Makka without sufficient provisions, on the pretence that they trust in Allah's help, thus becoming a burden on their fellow travellers. Making provision may also mean making provision for the journey of life with piety and righteousness. Surely the best provision is taqwa - guarding against evil or safeguarding with full awareness of divine laws. If the men of understanding desire increase in provision, here and in the hereafter, then they should know the boundaries and fortify them.\n"

A zealous votary of the idols, a mortal foe of the line of Hashim, he convened an assembly of the Quraysh and their allies. All tribal heads held a conference on the instigation of Abu Sufyan and Abu Jahl. It was resolved that one man from every tribe should go to the Holy Prophet's house in the darkness of the night and kill him jointly, in order to divide the guilt, and baffle the vengeance of the Bani Hashim. In the stupidity of their ignorance, they forgot that Allah is seeing, hearing, and His hand (Ali) was alive, who, from his earliest days, had committed himself to save the Holy Prophet at all costs. In the dark night, the conspirators surrounded the house of the Holy Prophet. Meanwhile, Allah commanded the Holy Prophet to leave Makka at once and go to Madina. The Holy Prophet intimated Ali of the divine plan and asked him to lie down on his bed, in order to lead the enemies into thinking that it was the Holy Prophet himself who was sleeping, thus giving him enough time to go away from Makka (unnoticed). Ali asked the Holy Prophet if his lying down in his bed would save the Holy Prophet's life, to which he answered in the affirmative. So Ali lay down on the Holy Prophet's bed, covering himself with his blanket. Ali made a willing choice of certain death, as the blood-thirsty enemies were lurking around the house to kill the Holy Prophet in his bed at any time during the night.\nAli willingly agreed to die because:\n(1) in his opinion the life of the Holy Prophet was more valuable than his own;\n    he was absolutely certain that it was the duty of a true believer to obtain the pleasure of Allah and His messenger, even if one's life has to be bartered;\n    he had the peace of mind which gave him courage to sleep, while the naked swords were flashing to \nstrike him - a singular example of willing surrender to Allah's will;\n"

The Muslims were on the brink of losing faith in Allah and His prophet as they had done in the battle of Uhad. Every one, among them, was hiding his head, lest the messenger of Allah might command him to accept the challenge. Some, among them, began to narrate the daring acts of the dare-devil in order to discourage their friends. Though they are held as great heroes of Islam by their ignorant followers, they refused to go to fight the challenger when asked by the Holy Prophet, because they relied more upon the advice of their comrades than on Allah's help. After that the Holy Prophet wanted to know who would go to meet the enemy? He repeatedly asked this question. Every time only Ali came forward. At last Ali, \"the total faith,\" as aptly described by the Holy Prophet, went to fight against Amar bin Abdwud, \"the total disbelief\". Ali, in no time, killed the formidable champion of the invaders. When the total faith of Ali in Allah and His messenger, through his matchless bravery, was established, there came a violent storm which ruined the enemy camp and routed their fighting forces.

This verse tells us the order in which charity should be given. First, in the list, are the parents, then the near kindred, the orphans, the needy and the wayfarer. There is no reward if parents and the nearer kindred are overlooked in order to meet the demands of others. The needs of the parents should be cared for as a duty without the embarrassment of their having to ask for the same. The Holy Prophet advised his followers to take care of the parents, brothers and sisters, and the nearest relatives first, and then the others. It must also be noted that wars (in self-defence) require funds. To finance such wars is as important as spending for the helpless relatives, because it is in the interest of the whole community that the invaders should not be allowed to destroy the polity of the faithful.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nWhat should be spent in the way of Allah?

To stop this universal movement, the pagans, the Jews and the Christians left no stone unturned, because they wanted to maintain the status quo of the exploitation of man by man, to serve the interests of the wicked, devilish and brutal ruling classes. But the Holy Prophet could not give up his divinely commissioned mission, so he did not. He had to take steps to liquidate kufr in order to serve the cause of truth. Before him the other messengers of Allah did the same. Even the followers of Christ and Buddha could not do without pre-emptive strike to forestall hostile actions.

When the harm of a thing is stated to be greater than its advantage, it is sufficient indication of its prohibition, for no sensible person would take a course which is sure to bring him a much greater loss than an advantage.\"\nEven after the revelation of this verse some of the companions of the Holy Prophet used to drink non-grape wines and come to pray salat in the masjid, on account of which verse 43 of al Nisa and verses 90 and 91 of al Ma-idah were revealed to prohibit intoxicants and gambling.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Curse of Allah be on liquor, its maker and he who assists him, bearer, loader, distributor, seller, purchaser, consumer and whoever uses its sale proceeds and profit.\"\nImam Ali ibna abi Talib said:\nIf a drop of liquor falls into a well and a minaret is built on its nearby land I will not recite azan from it; and if it falls into a river and in its dry bed grows grass, I will not let my horse graze on it.\nLiquor is ummul khaba-ith, the mother of all vices. An intoxicated person ceases to be a human being, becomes a brute and loses the ability to distinguish between good and evil, right and wrong.\nThe effect of these verses worked wonders with the Arab Muslims. In the opinion of the social reformers who labour day and night to put an end to the drinking habits of non-Muslim communities it is a miracle. Drinking was second nature to the heathen Arabs. The Jews and the Christians were also sunk deep into this wicked addiction.\nYasara, the root of maysir, means to divide a thing into parts or portions. Maysir means a game of chance to seek quick and easy wealth, an unearned profit. Gain or loss is a matter of chance. This verse prohibits all games of chance and gambling.\nFor al afwa see commentary of verse 215 of this surah.\n"

Allah cannot be made an urdah (obstacle) in the way of doing good, safeguarding against evil, and making peace between men. It is an injunction to abstain from making \"swearing by Allah\" a pretext for withholding oneself from doing good. Good must be done at all events. For example the \"swearing by Allah\" of a husband in anger, that he will not go to his wife, has been forbidden. (See also al Qalam: 10; al Ma-idah: 89).\nVain oath means unintentional swearing, which is a common habit with most people in their ordinary conversation. Allah will not hold any one accountable for vain oaths, but He will call His creatures to account for their real intentions and what they do. Verbal swearing has no value. However, swearing with full consciousness of the seriousness of the undertaking, binds the swearer to do as resolved provided the deed to be done is legal and good. Before Islam, it was a custom among the Arabs that when a husband avowed to discontinue conjugal relations with his wife, the wife was left in a lurch - neither a married woman nor a divorcee. The Quran ignores the swearing concerning disassociation with wives and gives four months for reconsideration and reconciliation; after which, if the husband still desires separation he should divorce his wife, otherwise the wife can refer the matter to the hakim shara (competent authority on Islamic laws) and obtain freedom from the bond of marriage to wed someone else.\nFa-in- fa-u means if they return to their wives within the prescribed four months Allah will forgive them.\n"

To warn the husbands who, unjustly and without reason, divorce their wives, the phrase \"Allah is surely hearing, knowing\" has been added. Only Islam safeguards the interests of women. According to the Holy Prophet, of all the permissible acts, divorce is the one most disliked by Allah, so as to keep in check any indiscriminate use of this pragmatic sanction. Therefore, in Islam, divorce is the most loathsome of the permitted acts. Marriage is an alliance of two individuals who love each other. Without love and understanding, it becomes a soulless body. In this situation, the sooner it is undone the better. If due to events and reasons, beyond control, day to day life of a married couple becomes a burden and a misery, separation is necessary and is an act of charity. Islam has the essential and elastic laws to deal with every type of case and circumstance and to control the harmony of the society as well as to safeguard the interest of every individual.\nDivorce, though legalised by Islam, has been so controlled and restricted through the observations of the Holy Prophet that its indiscriminate use is not possible by those who sincerely believe in Allah and follow the teachings of the Holy Prophet and his holy Ahl ul Bayt.

The divorced woman is required to keep herself in waiting for three menstrual periods, during which the husband has to support and care for her. In the course of these three months, if it is found out that she is pregnant, then the parental propriety of the offspring is established. Above all, the door of reconciliation remains open. If there is real love between them, the husband can take the wife back before the expiry of iddat (prescribed period of waiting). Such a practical arrangement is not available in any religion except Islam.\nThe legal rights given to women by Islam brought a revolutionary change in human society for the first time. So far woman was a wicked creature, the agent of the devil, and therefore was treated like a chattel, occupying the lowest position in the family and community. Islam gave women an honourable status, similar to men. It was a dynamic change, unknown to history, because it was never even considered, in pre-lslamic period, that women could have rights over men.\n\"But the men are a degree above women\" refers to the natural differences which separate men from women. Allah is all-wise, therefore, particularly in the case of divorce, man can initiate the course of divorce, but a woman cannot. She, no doubt, can go to a qadi to obtain separation on the ground of unbearable maltreatment and demand dissolution of marriage by surrendering her right to mahar (dowry). This provision is reasonable because it prevents women from obtaining separation on flimsy grounds.\nIslam gives women the right of choosing her life-partner. No one can compel her to accept any man as her husband. The matter lies entirely on her independent judgement. So she does not have the right to take the initiative for annulment of wedlock. Yet she has a recourse. She can go to a mujtahid or hakim sharah and obtain separation and then marry again whomsoever she likes.\n"

It is an effective check to prevent divorce on account of emotional outbursts and high-handedness of a husband who may recover his balance of mind and reconsider his unreasonable pronouncement. Before Islam, a man could divorce his wife as many times as he liked and take her back. To stop this absurd farce, only two revocable pronouncements of Talaq have been prescribed by Islam. After the third announcement, the Talaq is complete and becomes irrevocable. Even after Talaq the husband has to treat the divorced wife with kindness. It is not lawful for the husband to take back or withhold any part of what he has given to his wife or promised to give her as mahar (dowry).\n\"What she gives up to become free\" refers to khula or mubarat, the recourse a wife can avail to obtain separation, explained above, by the arbitration of the hakim sharah or mujtahid, by returning the dowry if she has taken it in advance, or by foregoing it.\n\"If you fear\" refers to the lawfully constituted religious authority - hakim sharah or mujtahid. If the husband revokes his decision he must keep his wife in good relationship and honour, and respect her.\nThe pronouncement of Talaq more than once at a time is meaningless in view of the \"divorce may be pronounced twice\" (the opening words of this verse) because it stipulates chances of reconciliation after the first, and if not, after the second pronouncement.\nAs mentioned in verse 97 of al Barat, \"these are the limits of Allah\", are the divine commandments.\n"

If a man pronounces a divorce whilst in a state of inebriety from drinking fermented liquor, such as wine, the divorce takes place. Repudiation by any husband who is sane and adult is effective, whether he be free or slave, willing or acting under compulsion; and even though it were uttered in sport or jest, or by mere slip of the tongue instead of some other word.\" (Fatwas Alamgiri - cited by Hughes)\nNo doubt the Islamic law of divorce has been criticised as contemptible and ridiculous.\nThe Shia school condemns all irregular forms of divorce. For Shias it is necessary that the man who pronounces a divorce be an adult, sane and free in his choice, will, design and intention. It does not take effect if given implicatively or ambiguously, even if there is intention. According to the teachings of the holy Imams, it is also absolutely necessary that the pronouncement must be made by the husband in the presence of two just witnesses; non-fulfilment of this condition renders the divorce null and void.

The people despised Talut's kingship because he did not have wealth, which they had in abundance.\nThe essential qualities required in a leader are clearly discernible if careful attention is paid to the reply given by Samuel:\n    Inallahas-tafahu alaykum-Allah has chosen him in preference to you. According to the divine law a \nleader of the people (temporal or spiritual) is chosen by Allah, not by the people.\n    Wa zadahu bastatan fil ilmi wal jism-And He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and \nphysique.

This knowledge is given to those leaders whom He Himself elects\nto lead and guide the people.\nMan's hypocrisy, doubt, denial, bickering and disagreement about leadership, in spite of clear and specific prophetic directions, arise in all religions. The same thing occurred among the Muslims after the departure of the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet, in compliance with Allah's command, had appointed Ali as his vicegerent and successor in the open assembly of ashira and in the large gathering at Ghadir Khum. Ali's superiority over others in knowledge and physical strength is unquestionable. It is acknowledged by all. Please refer to pages I to 7, and the commentary of verses 2 to 5, 30 to 39 and 124 of this surah, to know the divine decrees and clear prophetic directions, according to which Ali alone was the true divinely chosen successor of the Holy Prophet. But, while the Holy Prophet was on his deathbed, the Muslims began to lobby for and squabble over power, following their limited and imperfect logic, intending to build a Muslim empire based upon heathen theories and practices, instead of following the guidance given by Allah and His last messenger. As long as man continues to passively remain under the influence of his baser tendencies, this state of chaos and confusion in the affairs of his life will continue, as it did after the departure of the Holy Prophet, when the Muslim ummah refused to obey the command of Allah (Ma-idah: 67), conveyed to them by the Holy Prophet at Ghadir Khum, in spite of the fact that total submission to the decisions of the Holy Prophet has been prescribed as the first fundamental condition of the faith, by the Quran, in verse 65 of al Nisa.\nTo avoid chaos, discord and confusion which would lead to the destruction of the foundation of the Islamic society, the Holy Prophet took special precautions, which no other prophet before him had ever taken, to guide the people through clear actions, statements and signs that, after him, they should remain attached to his Ahl ul Bayt and follow their leadership. Unfortunately, the people chose to follow policies which led them astray into the hands of the devil.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe instructions inferred from this verse are as under:\nLegislation, process of governing and administration of justice are the functions of a sovereign. And sovereignty belongs to Allah, He delegates all the functions to a single person as His vicegerent, or chooses different persons to carry out one or more of them separately. Samuel had been entrusted with the authority to convey legislation and administer justice. When the people requested for a king as an executor, Allah appointed Talut as their king. It means in the presence of a divine legislator and judge, an executor can also be appointed . It makes clear that Samuel (the prophet) had no right to appoint an executor. It also gives permission to allow the people to have a say in the formation of the executive authority. The voice of the people may also be heard in addition to the book and the sunnah of the Holy Prophet, if not contradictory to these two agencies, in legislative and judicial functions. But to claim sovereignty, which belongs only to Allah, is to return to the days of ignorance. It is not Islam.\nJihad (war in the way of Allah) was prescribed and carried out by the prophets also.\nThe reaction of the people to the divine appointment of the executor can be favourable or unfavourable. The Jews did not like the appointment of Talut as a king. Likewise, the Muslims also did not approve the appointment of Ali as the successor of the Holy Prophet. The unfavourable reaction of the people, based upon ignorance and short-sightedness, can be compared to the reaction of the angels when Allah appointed Adam as His vicegerent. The answer to this reaction is almost the same as given in verses 30 to 39 of this surah.\nWhenever the question of succession to the Holy Prophet in the matters of legislation, execution and justice is dealt with, the implications of this verse should be taken into consideration. Verse 55 of al Nur gives strength to the point of view of the followers of Muhammad and Ali Muhammad.\n"

The word baqiyyah is interpreted by them as \"the best of a thing\", whereas it means \"that which is left behind\". This kind of interpretations are put forward by the Ahmadi (also known as Qadiani) commentators because their prime motive is to deny miracles attributed to the prophets of Allah, as Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, the false prophet of Qadian could never ever produce a miracle. The list of their twisting of the verses of the Quran and the traditions of the Holy Prophet is very long which cannot be discussed here. They are always in search of some imaginary meaning of the word, other than the actual one, be it the most obscure and far-fetched, to serve their purpose. Such misinterpretations are presented with the full force of as many conjectures as possible. The Qadiani (Ahmadi) school is diametrically antagonistic to the faith of the Ahl ul Bayt who are the only divinely authorised custodians and teachers of the Quran according to the hadith al thaqalayn.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\nMy Ahl ul Bayt are like the ark of Nuh. Whoso gets into it is saved and whoso stays away is drowned and lost.\nVerse 35 of Yunus and verse 22 of al Mulk make it clear that a true guide is he who is guided and appointed by Allah Himself. He does not receive any type of education and training from any one other than Allah.\nSo any one, who is not guided and appointed by Allah as a guide, is an impostor.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe executor appointed by Allah (see verse 247 of al Baqarah) should have the divine signs, the sacred heritage of the divinely chosen lineage which is endowed with the tranquillity (sakinah), on account of which no worldly or temporal force or consideration would frighten him from the way and cause of Allah. Such an appointed executor who slept in the bed of the Holy Prophet on the night of the migration is praised in verse 207 of al Baqarah (see commentary); and the sorry plight of the man who by himself claimed the executorship with the help of his comrades is exposed in verse 40 of al Tawbah. On every occasion it was Ali, the beloved of Allah and His messenger, who fearlessly strived in the cause of Allah and destroyed the enemies of Allah and His messenger, while the rest of the companions either watched the fighting from a safe distance or ran away from the battlefield; this was so because there was tranquillity in Ali's heart from the Lord, as has been confirmed by verse 26 of al Tawbah and verse 26 of al Fat-h. Besides this in-built tranquillity, the appointed executor must possess the divine heritage of the holy house, therefore, in view of the saying of the Holy Prophet that \"Ali is to me as Harun was to Musa\", the divine authority to guide and administer human society cannot be claimed by any one who does not belong to the holy Ahl ul Bayt (Nisa: 54).\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:249]\nThis verse depicts the differentiation between those who are the real followers of the path of submission and truth, and those who are not. He who leads the people must have the knowledge of what is good and what is evil for his followers, and also should be able to find out ways and means to correctly ascertain the sincerity of their faith. Talut tests his men by means of the river (saying: whoever then drinks from it, he is not of me, and whoever does not taste of it, he is certainly of me, except he who takes as much of it as fills his hand), but only a few of them are found faithful.\nIt must be noted that although the men with Talut were aware of their weakness against Jalut, they did not desert him, but history is a witness to the fact that some of the companions of the Holy Prophet not only ran away from the battlefield (Uhad) but also advised their comrades to return to their former state of idolatry, because they loudly announced that the Holy Prophet had been killed. They did not realise that Ali (the hand of Allah) was there to defend the Holy Prophet and disperse the hordes of enemy soldiers single-handedly and turn the impending defeat into a glorious victory. Ali did the same in every battle that the Holy Prophet fought against the infidels (see the books of history written by well-known Muslim authors), but after the departure of the Holy Prophet, the deserters became the heroes of Islam and Ali was forced to withdraw himself from the public life, although he continued to guide the sincere followers who came to him to seek guidance and wisdom.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:251]\nAn account of the formidable strength of the mighty forces of Jalut is given in 1 Samuel 17: 4 to 11. Dawud killed Jalut in single combat. The Philistines, when they saw that their hero was dead, turned and ran.\nA similar event took place in the early days of Islam. The infidels of Makka with a mighty host of twelve thousand warriors encircled Madina to destroy a few hundred Muslims, including women and children. On the suggestion of Salman, a ditch was dug around the city in six days. This battle is known as the battle of khandaq (ditch) or ahzab. Amr bin Abdwad, a warrior who used to defeat one thousand soldiers single-handedly, jumped over the ditch and threw an open challenge to the Muslims. The Holy Prophet turned towards his companions, and invited each of them to go and fight Amr on behalf of Islam, but there was fear and panic in their hearts, as some of them had been close to him in the days of their infidelity and had witnessed his acts of bravery and strength. No one came out at the call of the Holy Prophet. Then Amr shouted aloud the names of the famous companions, one by one, but each looked aside. The Holy Prophet repeated his call three times. There was no response. Each time only Ali came forward and said:\n\"I am ready to fight him O the messenger of Allah.\"\nAfter the third call the Holy Prophet put his turban on Ali's head and said:\n\"Verily, here goes total belief to fight against total disbelief.\"\n\"Allahu akbar' said Ali and hit Amr with his sword. It cut his sword, shield, iron head-gear in half, and Amr's head was lying on the ground.\n\"Here is the head of the enemy of Allah and Islam O messenger of Allah\", Ali said and put Amr's severed head before the Holy Prophet.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"One strike of Ali, on the day of khandaq, is superior to all worship of both the worlds put together.\"\nPlease also refer to the commentary of verse 214 of this surah.\nIn the battle fought between the Jews and the Philistines the enemy ran away when Dawud killed Jalut; in like manner the whole army of infidels of Makka left the battlefield in chaos and confusion when Ali killed Amr, completely routed and annihilated. These two events are meaningfully connected because perhaps there is no other battle where an army of a large number of fighting men left the battlefield when only one warrior was killed. And Allah gave him (the conquering warrior) kingdom and wisdom. Since kingdom belongs to Allah, He grants it to whom he likes, on merit after test and trial, to exercise divine authority on His behalf. It was given to Dawud. It was given to Ali (as imamat). The right to administer the human society was also given to Ali. It is another issue that the people did not allow him to do so, but the office of imamat given to him could not be usurped by any one, because the ability to guide and wisdom, particularly bestowed by Allah, cannot be stolen.\nThe last part of this verse says that the purpose of war is not to gain territorial expansion but to dispel mischief and establish peace on the earth.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nBefore Adam \"survival of the fittest\" was the driving force among all types of creatures. In the struggle for existence, every living being used all available means, good or bad, to obtain maximum resources, without giving any thing to other fellow beings. It was almost an animal society. It was evil. Islam stopped it. With the development of intellectual faculties and inspiration, natural tendencies gave place to moral values, and instead of fighting for food and material necessities, men began to distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad. Verse 40 of al Hajj gives permission to fight against those who deprive people from the essential freedom to worship Allah and to make use of His bounties justly and equitably. Those who strive in the cause of Allah, to put an end to the survival of the fittest theory, receive help from Allah. Therefore the true servants of Allah vie with one another to fight against the evil in their own selves and in the society in order to be nearer to Allah. \"And everyone has a direction to which he turns, so hasten to do good (Baqarah: 184).\" \"So vie one with another in good deeds (Ma-idah: 48).\" To stop this striving in the cause of Allah means reversion to the animal way of life. And were it not for Allah's repelling some men by means of others the earth would certainly be in a state of disorder.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:253]\nAlthough all the prophets of Allah are equally truthful and holy, but in the same way that some signs are clearer and contain deeper messages than others, so Allah's messengers are of different ranks. The particular mention of Musa and Isa is to point out their distinguished positions as the reformers. Musa was directly addressed by Allah, and Isa was assisted by the ruhul qudus (the holy spirit). Both these prophets of Allah glorified the Holy Prophet and gave to the people the glad tidings of his arrival. Refer to the text of the Bible (Deut 18: 5, 18, 19; Acts 3: 22 to 25; John 14: 16, 17; John 16: 7 to 14) mentioned in the commentary of al Baqarah: 40.\nIt would be a false and contradictory statement if it was said that the above-noted verses of the Old and the New Testaments refer to Jesus, because Isa himself, like Musa, gave the news of the advent of the Holy Prophet in John 14: 16, 17 and John 16: 7 to 14.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn addition to the guiding statements of the two distinguished prophets of Allah - Musa to whom Allah spoke, and Isa to whom He gave clear miracles and strengthened with the holy spirit. there are several verses in the Quran, according to which the Holy Prophet occupies the highest place in the company of all the prophets of Allah. He is the superior-most messenger of Allah. The glory of the divinity of the Lord manifests, reflects and radiates in him to maximum perfection. Endowed with perfection, he was sent as a \"mercy unto the worlds\" (Ambia: 107). The other prophets were sent to guide a particular people in a particular place (Matthew 10: 5 and 6), therefore, in view of their limited mission, they are not on the level of the Holy Prophet who was sent to guide and discipline the whole mankind for all times (Saba: 28). As the Holy Prophet is the best of all the prophets of Allah, a distinguished group among his followers has been raised up by Allah as khayra ummatin, the best of all the people (see commentary of verse 110 of Ali Imran).\nTo understand kalamallaku (Allah spoke) it is necessary to refer to verse 51 of al Shura:\n\"It is not to any mortal (man) that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration or through (from behind) a veil,\"\nAllah does not speak in the sense attributed to the created beings who use the mouth and the tongue to produce sound. The veil can be anything which can be caused to produce sound.\nThis verse implies that a large number of messengers were sent by Allah. He made some of these messengers to excel others, and some of them He exalted in rank. In the end He sent the best of them all, the Holy Prophet, to guide mankind on the right path and prevent the people of the world, in all times, from going astray in the direction of Shaytan, their avowed enemy. There is no compulsion in religion. It is not the plan of the almighty that guidance should be imposed upon any individual or community. There is complete freedom to any person who wants to go astray. Allah does not keep any one on the right path under duress if he himself, through reason and intelligence, does not make willing efforts to walk on the right path. The followers of the prophets, including the followers of the Holy Prophet, fought one another, went astray and followed the path of the devil as soon as the divinely commissioned guides, with clear signs and arguments, had left them. If Allah had willed, this straying could be stopped. He brings about what He wills. He could guide the people without the agency of the prophets, but He has given freedom to man to use reason and intelligence to distinguish between good and evil and make efforts to do good and earn reward, or make mischief and collect punishment. The door of guidance is kept open for those who sincerely seek the true direction.\nAs for those who strive in Us, We certainly show them our paths. (Ankabut: 69).\nTo fulfil this promise, the merciful Lord has established the divine institution of imamat as soon as the risalat came to an end-Ali ibna abi Talib is the first and Muhammad al Mahdi, the living Imam, is the last of the twelve divinely commissioned and infallible holy guide-leaders.\nTo keep himself on the right path, man has been asked to seek Allah's help by reciting al Fatihah in every salat. See the commentary of verses 5 to 7 of al Fatihah.\nThe guidance has been made known. Now whosoever goes right, it is only for the good of his own soul that he goes right, and whosoever errs, errs only to hurt himself. Each soul earns only on its own account. According to the following verses, man has been given an independent free will to act:\nBAQARAH : 48\nAN-AM : 165\nHIJR : 42\nBANI ISRAIL : 7 and 15\nANKABUT : 6\nFATIR : 17\nZUMAR : 7\nHA MIM : 46\nDAHR : 2\nThe individual differences in the prophets of Allah are on account of the level of intelligence and the needs of the people amongst whom they were sent, to show them what was right and what was wrong. The manner of receiving the inspiration from Allah and the nature and limitation of every prophet's mission were determined in accordance with the ability of the people to understand and grasp the message. The last message of Allah was perfect, complete, final and conclusive. Therefore, the prophet who was chosen to deliver the final message was the most superior of all the prophets. He was not only the last prophet but also the foremost in total submission to the will of Allah.\nMusa was honoured with the divine speech, Isa with the holy spirit, Ibrahim with shuhud (vision), but the Holy Prophet had the distinction of receiving the divine inspiration and revelation through all the mediums-see verse 43 of al Anfal and verse 60 of Bani Israil for vision in dreams, verse I of Bani Israil for vision in wakefulness; verses 192 to 195 of al Shu-ara, verse 52 of al Shura for the holy spirit; verses 1 to 16 of al Najm and verses 1 to 4 of al Rahman for direct instructions .\nThis verse clearly states that the discord and strife among the followers of the prophets is due to belief (iman) and disbelief (kufr), therefore, the apologetic attempt of some of the theologians to justify the dissension and conflict between the various religions or the sects of each religion as the outcome of ijtihad or discretion is based upon conjecture, and therefore, untenable.\nAccording to Quran, such differences between the people of the scriptures is due to their rebellious attitude against the clearly manifested will and command of Allah. See verse 19 of Ali Imran and verses 13 of 14 of al Shura. The responsibility for wrongdoing rests with the man; and whatever good he does is from Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:254]\nPlease refer to the commentary of verses 3, 195 and 215 of this surah for spending out of what Allah gives, and verses 48 and 123 of this surah for intercession. To provide or give help in cash and kind to the needy has been identified with the \"spending in the way of Allah\". It is an exhortation, not a compulsion. According to your conscience you have the liberty to spend in the way of Allah \"out of what He has given to you\", whether you have large means or a moderate income.\n\"Before the day comes\" implies that one has to do good in this world. What you sow (in this life) you shall reap (in the life of the hereafter). \"There will be no bargaining, nor any friendship nor intercession\" means that wrongdoers will not be able to claim salvation in exchange of good deeds done by their ancestors or their posterity; or on account of the acts of their religious leaders as the Christians think that Jesus, by his blood, has redeemed the sins of his followers. This verse categorically denies this type of assertion and warns the people not to indulge in such a false belief. The wicked will be punished.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nTo make the social life in this world egalitarian every individual should contribute to the welfare of the human society out of what Allah gives him. The overall effect of this system covers every person in the community.\n\"The unbelievers are the unjust\" implies that injustice is the root of all other wrongs. According to verse 13 of Luqman ascribing partners unto Allah is the greatest injustice.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:255]\nThis verse is known as the ayat ul kursi-the verse of the seat or throne of the almighty, omnipotent and wise authority of Allah. This verse is an ayah of protection. In it is mentioned all that we the mortals can ever know about Allah.\n\"Allah is He beside whom there is no god\" - please refer to the commentary of verse 1 of al Fatihah for the word \"Allah\".\nNot only the denial of false gods, but also the belief in the absolute unity of Allah without any complexity of any kind, in any sense, in His ever-living and self-subsisting supreme being, is the first and the foremost doctrine of Islam. Complexity suggests an interdependence among the components which means the \"whole\" depends upon the performance of the components. All the prophets of Allah, before the Holy Prophet, also preached the unity of Allah, but the perfect unity made known through the Holy Prophet could not be presented to the people of earlier times because their intellect and perception had not developed enough to understand the ever-living and self-subsisting being of Allah. The following words, spoken by Isa, are quoted as an example:\nThere is still much that I could say to you, but the burden would be too great for you now. However, when he comes who is the spirit of truth, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but will tell only what he hears; and he will make known to you the things that are coming. (John 16: 12 and 13).\nEvery prophet of Allah preached the unity of Allah. The idea of trinity was not given by Isa. It is an after-thought of the Christian church. Please read the following quotations from the Old and the New Testaments.\nOld Testament:\nGod spoke, and these were His words:\n\"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.\nYou shall have no other god to set against me.\nYou shall not make a carved image for yourself nor the likeness of anything in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth\". (Exodus 20: I to 4).\nHear O Israel, the Lord is our Lord, One Lord. (Deut 6: 4)\n\"I am the Lord, the Lord is my name; I will not give my glory to another god, nor my praise to any idol.\" (Isaiah 42: 8)\nThus says the Lord, Israel's king, the Lord of hosts, his ransomer:\n\"I am the first and I am the last, and there is no god but me.\" (Isaiah 44: 6)\n\"I am the Lord, there is no other; there is no god beside me.\"\n\"I am the Lord, there is no other.\"\n\"There is no god but Me; there is no god other than 1.\"\n\"I am God, there is no other.\" (Isaiah 45: 5, 18, 21, 22).\n\"I am God, there is no other.\" (Isaiah 46: 9)\n\"I am He; I am the first, I am the last also. (Isaiah 48: 12)\nNew Testament:\nA false god has no existence in the real world.\nThere is no god but one.\nYet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom all beings comes. (1 Corinthians 8: 4 and 6)\nOne Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all. (Ephesians 4: 5 and 6).\nProphet after prophet came and awakened man step by step and degree by degree. Finally the Holy Prophet, the brightest light, was sent to expose and explain the ultimate truth, as promised by Allah, to enlighten the human mind and heart with the knowledge through which man can become aware of the Lord God, but comprehends only what his power of contemplation can bear.\nIt is reported that there are three kinds of existence;\n(1) WAJIB UL WUJUD\nThe self-existing existence. The primal cause. There can never be any effect without a cause. The universe, therefore, was created by the self-existing creator, the primal cause.\n(2) MUMKIN UL WUJUD\nThe creatures or created beings whose creation is possible only if the creator so wills.\n(3) MUMTANI UL WUJUD\nThe impossible existence. The existence of another being like Allah is not possible because there cannot be two equals in the sense of oneness. If there are two equals in this sense, then there is no meaning in their being two, separated from each other. They must be one. If there are two such beings then there must be a dividing factor which makes the two as two and maintains their two separate entities, in which case the dividing factor will be the wajib ul wujud, therefore, such an existence is neither possible nor real.\nWajib ul wujud, therefore, means the self-existing existence of the ever-living and self-subsisting creator. To maintain His self-existing existence He must be an omnipotent authority who not only owns absolute knowledge of the existence but also the will that does what it wills. His control is absolute. His attributes are His self, inseparable from Him from any point of view or in any imaginable meaning or sense, as the meaning is inseparable from a word or as equiangularity is inseparable from an equilateral triangle. As the limited knowledge of the finite being cannot conceive of anything without referring to its attributes, we give names to the attributes of Allah, with the help of our visualisation, to have a suggestive idea of His absolute existence. Therefore, the Shia school holds it as a cardinal doctrine of faith not to think of any of His attributes as a separate entity from His existence. All the attributes of Allah are one absolute unity, because, if they are not, then it would mean complexity, which negates the absolute independence of the omnipotent authority. His existence means His authority, His authority means His knowledge, and likewise all His attributes are so linked together that they are one indivisible unity. Allah is a transcendental reality. He is unknowable. He is an infinite being, beyond the conceivability of our finite consciousness. He is inconceivable. He is hayyul qayyum, the ever-living, the self-subsisting (Ali Imran: 2; Ta Ha: 111, Mumin: 65).\nImam Ali says:\nO He!\nO He whom none knows what He is,\nnor how He is,\nnor where He is,\nnor in what respect He is;\nexcept He. (Dua al-Mashlul)\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nQayyum is a magnified form of the adjective qayam - standing, lasting, enduring. It implies He who stands by Himself, and all others stand because of His (eternal) endurance. His relation to His creatures is like the source of light to the rays of the light, or like the mind to the concepts, not like the relation of an architect or a builder to a construction he builds. It is exactly as Ali ibna abi Talib has said-\"Every thing stands by means of Him\". He is the self-subsisting everlasting, therefore, He is the first and the last, and the apparent and the hidden (Hadid: 2 and 3); and He is the knower of all things, and He is with everything but is not computed with anything (Mujadilah : 7; Ma-idah: 73).\nWhile trying to visualise His attributes, it is necessary not to be misled by the finite inferences. His activity does not at all mean movement to perform an act by employing energy as we do. Awareness of His attributes, based upon reason and contemplation, may appear pure and perfect to us, but, in fact, it remains a shadow of the reality which transcends all faculties of comprehension.\n\"Slumber does not overtake Him\", means that He is not influenced by any change whatsoever. He is beyond time and states, for He encompasses time and all states. He is the ever vigilant, or the true and perfect vigilance itself.\n\"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His\" means that He is the creator of matter. If the \"matter\" is not created by Allah, and is said to be eternally existing as He is, then He is only a fashioner of things out of matter, in which case nothing belongs to Him. There is no propriety in this conjecture. It is unreasonable to say that there are two independent eternal equals. If matter is accepted as an independent and uncreated eternal, then Allah, to prove His existence, will need the matter to carry out His creative plan, otherwise the matter will remain idle. There is no meaning in the idea of two eternal equals, separated from each other. They must be one. If there are two such beings, then there must be a dividing factor which makes the two as two and maintains their two separate entities, in which case the dividing factor, superior in will and authority will be the ever-existing supreme being.\n\"Who can intercede with Him, except by His permission?\" implies that though Allah is the almighty and the absolute sovereign but as He is also the merciful, the compassionate, He has given permission to \"Muhammad and Ali Muhammad\", the thoroughly purified, to intercede on behalf of the sinners. The issue of intercession has been dealt with in detail in the commentary of verse 48 of this surah. Please refer to it.\n\"He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases\", means Allah's omniscience. The finite beings cannot hide anything from Allah. They cannot comprehend anything except what He pleases, no matter whatever knowledge and intelligence they possess. The facts which are unknown or unknowable to the finite beings are known to the infinite. Allah's knowledge is infinite and absolute. He is the knowing who knows ahead and in advance (in term of time and space) the origin and causality of knowledge. Although the ordinary human beings do not perceive that which is known to Allah only, but those who have been endowed with the divine knowledge are aware of the secrets of the universe.\nIn \"His kursi (seat of authority and knowledge) extends over the heavens and the earth\", although kursi literally means \"chair\", like arsh (used in other verses of the Quran) means \"throne\", but both these words have been used metaphorically. They refer to the divine knowledge and authority of the supreme, almighty and sovereign Allah, in relation to all that which has been created by Him. His \"relation\" with His creation, in time and space, remains unconditionally unaffected. His control over everything, created by Him, is perfect, complete and absolute. There is no limitation to the infinity of His existence, because the ever-existing existence is only His and it is He who gives existence to whom He wills. When we say \"He is here, there and everywhere\", we only make use of our limited and inadequate ability to understand and express His absolute infinity. He is the creator of time and space, therefore, His infinite existence cannot be conceived by the help of the knowledge derived from the system based upon experience and induction.\nAccording to the Ahl ul Bayt kursi or arsh, not connected with any kind of matter, is the manifestation of His knowledge and authority in relation to all that which has been created. It includes all the heavens and the earth. Arsh refers to Allah's hold and sway over all creation. In other words, the creation as a whole is the kursi or the throne of Allah from which all His divine attributes of knowledge, wisdom, might and glory manifest.\n\"And the preservation of them does not tire Him\" means the creation, as a whole, is sustained by Him, and its continued existence is maintained by Him. The laws (created by Him), governing the operation of creation, produce fatigue, therefore, He is independent of such laws. His absolute existence is eternal and everlasting.\n\"He is the most high, the great\", according to the Holy Prophet, is one of the most important verses of the Quran, which deals with the unity of Allah, His attributes, His relation to His creatures, the position of man in the order of creation, his instinctive desire to turn unto Him, his means of salvation and the ultimate reward and punishment.\nIn order to prevent the total seizure of mind and heart by the greatness of the kursi, mentioned in this verse, it is made clear in the end that Allah alone is the most high, the greatest.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:256]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThis verse states a psychological fact that the submissive attitude of the mind and heart towards any sacred object cannot be obtained by force or compulsion, therefore, only a clear view of the sacred generates the spontaneous conviction to adopt the right and reject the wrong. It is not an imperative but an indicative statement. There is no room for considering this verse as having been abrogated by any other verse dealing with jihad. This verse also asserts that after the right way has become clearly distinct from error, man must reject the false gods and believe in Allah.\nThis verse confirms that which has been said, in detail, in the commentary of verses 190 to 193 of this surah, about the false accusation by the European historians that the Holy Prophet used the sword to preach Islam.\nSir Edward Dennison Ross says:\n\"For many centuries the acquaintance which the majority of Europeans possessed of Muhammadanism was based almost entirely on distorted reports of fanatical Christians which led to the dissemination of a multitude of gross calumnies. What was good in Muhammadanism was entirely ignored, and what was not good, in the eyes of Europe, was exaggerated or misinterpreted. It must not, however, be forgotten that the central doctrine preached by Muhammad to his contemporaries in Arabia, who worshipped the stars; to the Persians who acknowledged Ormuz and Ahriman; the lndians, who worshipped idols; and the Turks, who had no particular worship, was the unity of God, and that the simplicity of his creed was probably a more potent factor in the spread of Islam than the sword of the ghazis\".\nEven William Muir, the worst enemy of Islam, in the following passage, admits that:\nIt is strongly corroborative of Muhammad's sincerity that the earliest converts to Islam were not only of upright character, but his own bosom friends and people of his household; intimately acquainted with his private life, who could not fail otherwise to have detected those discrepancies which ever more or less exist between the professions of the hypocritical deceiver abroad and his actions at home.\"\nThrough this verse peace, love and mutual understanding have been prescribed for the Muslims. Also refer to verse 125 of Bani Israil. There is no need for compulsion in religion because verse 2 of al Dahr says: \"Verily, we have shown him (man) the (right) way; (whether) he be grateful or disbelieving (ungrateful)!\"\nTaghut (the devil) means the inordinate, the rebel, the wrongdoer, the strayer, like Shaytan. The word taghut, in this verse, implies all the devilish tendencies and activities which mislead the people. The first step towards genuine belief in Allah is the rejection of the devil.\nIn other words hatred of the wicked (tabarra) takes precedence over the love of Allah and His chosen friends (tawalla). It is essential to clean the heart and the mind from the disturbing influence of falsehood and then expose them to the reflection of truth, otherwise conflicting impressions will create confusion and distort the beauty of the beloved. See verse 6 of al Ma-idah.\nUrwatil wuthqa means a strong rope - the firmest handhold. According to Imam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir, a true faithful, in order to remain attached with Allah and enjoy genuine godliness, must seek attachment with the thoroughly purified Ahlul Bayt (Allah's chosen friends) and love them (as ordained in verse 23 of al Shura). Imam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq has said that the firmest handhold means having complete faith (trust) in Allah. The Holy Prophet has declared that every faithful must hold fast the rope of Allah, Ali, because he, who remains attached with Ali, will never go astray. Ali is the ideal of the true faith in Allah. The true mode and manner of the faith is perfectly integrated in the divinely commissioned successors to the Holy Prophet - Ali and the holy Imams of the Ahlul Bayt, therefore, tawalla (love of Allah and Muhammad and Ali Muhammad) has been prescribed as one of the articles of the furu ud din.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIt is clearly indicated that faith consists of two fundamental factors:\n(1) The negation of what is against the legislative will of Allah - tabarra.\n(2) Belief in Allah and whatever He wills and commands - tawalla.\nBe averse to the wicked and be good to the virtuous. Be with the flowers as a flower and be far away from the thorns.\n \n"

It is used to refer to such closeness as exists between brothers, friends, neighbours and helpers. A master is also called wali because of his hold over his slaves - the hold brings the slave close to the master. Any one who exercises authority becomes a wali of those over whom the authority is exercised; therefore, a guardian, an administrator or a ruler is also called wali. Here, it means that Allah is the nearest authority over the faithful; and the false gods the authorities over those who disbelieve, and who push them into hell for ever.\nNur means the light of the faith or the true awareness about Allah and firm conviction in His authority.\nZulumat means the darkness of the disbelief in Allah or the ignorance and uncertainty about Allah.\nSee verses 35 and 36 of Ibrahim.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:258]\nIdol-worshippers, in ancient times, revered their kings as the representatives of God. Nimrud, in the days of prophet Ibrahim, claimed divinity. Boastful of his temporal power, he disputed with Ibrahim about the authority of the prophethood bestowed upon him by Allah, since Ibrahim's authority clashed with his absolute sway over the people, whose lives, he argued, depended on his decision; he could kill them at any time or let them live. Ibrahim rendered his argument null and void by pointing out his helplessness against the divine forces working in nature. Although there was no reply, yet Nimrud, an obstinate disbeliever, could not draw advantage from this clear guidance. The Ahmadi commentator says that ata does not mean \"gave\"; it means \"promised\". It is about the grant of kingdom to Ibrahim, in this verse, as well as in verse 54 of al Nisa. Even if it is taken as \"promised\", then Allah is the best fulfiller of promise. All His promises are fulfilled. To say that Allah's promise made with Ibrahim was a bogus and false undertaking is certainly kufr (disbelief in Allah).\n\"I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldees to give you this land to occupy\", says Genesis 15: 7; and the Quran repeats it in this verse.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe personal pronoun of the third person singular in the objective case hu may refer to Ibrahim, and the mulk means kingdom, the spiritual as well as rightful (see verse 54 of al Nisa); and if it refers to Nimrud then the mulk would mean temporal and actual though not rightful. However, the meaning and application of this verse remains the same as explained above.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:259]\nWherever \"giving life after death\" is used in Quran, the Ahmadi commentator and his like say that it is a metaphorical reference to the revival of the stagnant nations, because the Ahmadis are averse to the fact that Allah and His chosen friends are able to cause miracles. To them the death and revivification of prophet Uzayr, referred to in this verse, was only a vision, not an actual happening. Since their self-made prophet was unable to work any miracle, the Ahmadis have decided not to accept the agency of miracles at all. To show their point of view as the only truth, the Ahmadi commentator says: \"it appears that\" and then quotes the events connected with Ezekiel from chapter 37 of Ezekiel and misinterprets them to serve his perverted ideas, although there is nothing in common in the event referred to in this verse and the events mentioned in the above noted chapter of the Old Testament. It is not Ezekiel but Ezra (Uzayr) who is referred to in this verse. It refers to the death and revivification of Uzayr and his donkey, whilst the events in chapter 37 of Ezekiel refer to the revival of a town. It was prophet Uzayr who, like Ibrahim in the next verse, prayed and asked Allah to show him how the dead are brought back to life again.\nThe true account of the events that took place is given below:\nNebuchadnezzar conquered and destroyed Jerusalem. The corpses of the inhabitants were left to be eaten by the wild beasts and birds of prey. When prophet Uzayr passed by the ruins of the city, he wondered if the people whose desiccated bones were lying on the ground could ever be brought to life again so as to rebuild the devastated town? So Allah caused him and his donkey to die. After seventy years, Cyrus gave permission to rebuild Jerusalem. Within thirty years Jerusalem was an active city again. When Uzayr died, it was morning. After hundred years he was brought to life again. The sun had not yet set. \"How long have you tarried?\" the angel, who was sent to meet Uzayr, asked him.\nI have tarried a day, or part of a day,\" he replied.\nNo! You have tarried a hundred years,\" the angel informed him. He also asked him to look at his food and drink in his bag. It was as fresh as it was a hundred years ago. He looked at his donkey. There were only its bones lying beside him. As he was looking at his donkey, its scattered bones were joined together and it stood before him, alive and breathing. The purpose of this miracle was to make prophet Uzayr an instructive example to those who either do not know how the dead will be brought to life again on the day of resurrection, or who disbelieve in Allah's warning. So when it became clear to Uzayr, he said: \"I know that Allah has power over all things.\"\nAt home he found his son, born after his departure, one hundred years old; his young maid one hundred and twenty years old, and all his grandchildren older than him. They looked at the fifty year old Uzayr and wondered. Uzayr became a living sign of Allah's omnipotence.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:260]\nThe words of this verse are very clear. Ibrahim asked Allah to show him how Allah gives life to the dead, so that his heart may be at ease. It is narrated that as directed by Allah, Ibrahim took a pigeon, a peacock, a cock and a crow, cut them into very small pieces, mixed them together and put portions of the mixture on the top of four separate mountains, and then called out to them; they came flying to him as individual birds. It became clear to Ibrahim that Allah does what He wills because He is mighty, wise.\nThe Ahmadi commentator wrongly refers to ''Abraham said: O Lord God, how can I be sure that I shall occupy it?\" (Genesis 15 : 8). He does it to lower the status of Ibrahim, a true prophet of Allah, by saying that Ibrahim had asked Allah about a factor which any ordinary man of common sense knows without receiving information from anyone. Genesis 15: 8 refers to Ibrahim's prayer about the kingdom Allah promised to give him, whereas this verse refers to Ibrahim's request to show him how the dead will be brought to life again. When his arguments lead him to a dead end, the Ahmadi commentator presumes that this verse has been tampered with, because he cannot prove that this verse refers to the promise that the land of Canaan will be given to Ibrahim, although he gives irrelevant references from the Bible.\nSome spiritualists say that the slaying of the four kinds of birds is meaningful for those who aspire for a spiritual life.\n(1) The pigeon stands for social life - the love for family, friends and associates, which must be sacrificed.\n(2) The cock stands for animal passion which must be killed.\n(3) The crow stands for greed which must be destroyed.\n(4) The peacock stands for worldly adornment which must be smothered.\nWhen all the above four desires are crushed, the soul merits the bliss of the eternal life.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says;\n\"Allah gives life and causes to die, and then He gives life to the dead\", mentioned in verses 258, 259 and 260, makes clear the power and authority of almighty Allah, but to deny the miracles associated with the prophets of Allah, the Ahmadi commentator and others like him rely on conjecture to find out metaphorical parallels, as if they are aware of all that is possible or impossible, and the laws governing the operation of creation.\nOf such a claim, verse 51 of al Kahf says:\n\"I made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor at the creation of themselves, nor am I He who chooses those who lead (the people) astray, (as My) helpers.\"\nIn the following two Persian lyrics, life on earth in relation to heavenly existence has been meaningfully described.\n(1) What does the mosquito know from where came the garden and how it grew. It is born in the spring and dies in the autumn.\n(2) The heavenly existence addresses life on earth:\n\"For us, a century of years is only a breath,\nan ocean of yours a moisture,\nwe only see and move on.\"\nThe terms life and death can be applied, in the physical sense, to a man or any other creature, a group of men or a nation. It can also be applied to a man's or a nation's spiritual rise and fall, with reference to knowledge or faith or any accomplishment. In both the meanings it may take place in its usual or natural course, known to us, or it may take place on account of an unusual course. not known to or unknowable to us. Whatever takes place is an effect of Allah's will.\nThough many a commentator says that these verses refer to Ibrahim and the Israelite prophets. yet the Jews and the Christians of today may not accept their conclusions, based upon the references to the Old and the New Testaments, as likely and reliable. The Shia commentators rely on the reports and opinions of the Ahl ul Bayt whose source of information is the Holy Prophet whom Allah Himself gave the wisdom and knowledge of all creation directly. The ideas, theories and events presented by the scholars of the highest calibre, by referring to the Old or the New Testament or any other book, cannot be accepted if these do not agree with the Quran or the explanation or interpretation given by the holy Imams.\n"

Sublime was the devotee, Ali ibna abi Talib, who performed these two different acts at the same time - prayed as well as spent in the way of Allah, and, therefore, was declared to be the wali of the faithful along with Allah and His messenger, in verse 55 of al Ma-idah.\nWe are barren like rocks.

Neither Allah accepts it nor His servants give it any importance.\nIf the spirit or the intention behind the spending is to seek pleasure of Allah, then. if the means are large the corresponding spending will also be substantial and big-hearted and if the means are moderate, even then the spending will be sufficient. When heavy rain falls the tall trees of a garden bring forth their fruit twofold, but even light rain is sufficient, because rooted very deep, they draw adequate nutrition from the soil.\nIn the days of the Holy Prophet, the early Muslims lived in a hostile environment. It was a period of test and trial. The overwhelming forces of falsehood made their lives a bed of thorns, their relentless persecution hunted them, therefore, in the face of the preponderant danger to their lives and property, they had to sacrifice whatever they owned, lives as well as possessions, whenever either or both of them were needed.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:275]\nRiba literally means a growth or an addition. The additional amount, collected over and above the capital given as a loan, is interest or usury. It is an abuse or a misuse of the power one holds over the weak or the needy, and therefore, strictly forbidden. Spending in the way of Allah for the welfare of the human society has been prescribed in the preceding verses. With enough means at one's disposal, it is a sin not to part with some of it in order to help the needy. When giving in the way of Allah, as a free gift, under such circumstances, has been prescribed, then those whom Allah has given enough, must at least lend that which is needed by the needy, without charging any additional payment, because practising usury is akin to being confounded by Shaytan, and is tantamount to digging one's own grave. Inherent in a transaction of usury is the element of enslavement and abuse, because a person who is in need of material help cannot pay back more than what he had originally taken; therefore Islam has prohibited usury. In the transaction of usury, both the givers and the takers suffer. The lender, in love of more and more material gains, becomes heartless and selfish. Those who take loans become extravagant and ruin their families. This scenario is diametrically opposed to the very purpose of the religion of Islam - establishment of a fair, kind and welfare-oriented social order. If there is no temptation of usury, material help will be given to only those who are really in need of it.\nTrade, on the other hand, is a mutual transaction in which both parties feel satisfied, in which both either hope to gain or run the risk of a loss. If financial help is required for business or trading, a different relationship can be structured between the two parties, such as a partnership or some form of sharing profit and loss.\nThose who say usury is only like trading will rise on the day of resurrection in a state of insanity, as those rise whom Shaytan has prostrated by his touch.\nThe prohibition took effect from the day this verse was revealed. The usury collected by the lenders prior to the promulgation of this prohibition was allowed to be retained by them.\nIn banking transactions, the directions of the religious jurist {mujtahid-faqih) should be followed to determine bank charges, commission and profit as fixed or as agreed or as actual dividends.\n"

If we do not follow His guidance then surely we transgress. The laws prescribed in this verse develop and maintain a progressive, welfare-oriented, civilised social order.\nEvery contract of debt should be written down by a scribe with fairness. He who owes the debt should dictate without diminishing anything. If he is unsound or weak in understanding then his guardian should dictate with fairness. Two witnesses should be chosen to witness the written contract. If there are not two men, then one man and two women must be called in to witness, so that if one woman errs, the second may remind the other.\nIf the transaction is for ready merchandise which is given and taken from hand to hand, then there is no blame on any party in not writing it down.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nRefer to fiqh for the details pertaining to the contracts of debt. In this verse Allah teaches us to write down and record the fact so that there may be no dispute in future. The one very important consequence of learning the art of writing is literacy. According to the Quran knowledge or education is the most valuable virtue. According to Tabari, the Holy Prophet, in order to remove illiteracy, asked the literate pagan captives, after the battle of Badr, to teach reading and writing to the Muslims. In return, he set free one pagan if he had taught writing to ten Muslim boys. When the Quran has asked the faithful to record in writing the transactions between individuals to avoid disputes, then it become all the more imperative that the sayings and doings of the Holy Prophet, one of the two main sources of Islamic ideology and jurisprudence, should have been faithfully recorded. However on account of political exigency, after the departure of the Holy Prophet, it was not done, lest the fighting spirit of the Arab soldiers be adversely affected if their attention was diverted to intellectual progress. Not only was the writing down of the Holy Prophet's sayings stopped but large libraries in the conquered lands of Egypt and Persia were burned and destroyed in the days of the second caliph on the plea that if those books were in agreement with the Quran, they did not need it, and if they were not, then they deserved destruction (Tabari, Yaquti and others).\nAs a result of not writing down the sayings and doings of the Holy Prophet, a great many disputes surfaced among the Muslims, dividing them in several sects and schools of thought.\nAt a time when the Muslim ummah was conquering far away lands and bringing in camel-laden booties in the streets of Madina, according to the well-known Muslim historian, Amir Ali, in his book \"the Spirit of Islam\", Ali was giving lectures in the masjid to spread knowledge, wisdom and intellectual progress, which emerged in full force among the later Saracen race.\nIt must be noted that it was Ali who advised the second caliph not to destroy the famous library in Alexandria, which was founded by the Greek scholars. Ali and the men attached with the holy house of the Ahl ul Bayt continued to record the traditions of the Holy Prophet in writing. Bukhari refers to a sahifa maintained by Ali which contained the true dictations of the Holy Prophet.

Evil thoughts and intentions, even if not translated into actions, are liable to be examined for penalisation.\nSay (O Muhammad): Whether you hide that which is in your hearts or manifest it, Allah knows it. He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah has power over all things. (Ali Imran: 29)\nImam Ali says:\nAllah requites His servants by that which is in their hearts.\nHe forgives whomever He wills and punishes whomever He wills. He alone knows who deserves forgiveness, as mentioned in verse 271 of this surah: \"and this will do away with some of your evil deeds;\" and what type of sins earn definite punishment. It is Allah's will that prevails but never without justice.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says;\n\"And whether you manifest what is in your minds or hide it (intentions and motives), Allah will call you to account according to it\"; makes it clear that there is no room for treating this verse as abrogated.\nAll actions of Allah, including reward and punishment, are the immediate effects of His will. It does not mean that His actions are arbitrary. His justice, wisdom, grace, love and mercy are reflected in His will. There is no contradiction in His attributes which play a very important role in shaping His will. His will follows His wisdom.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 2:285]\nPlease study this verse with reference to the commentary of verse 253 of this surah and verse 55 of Bani Israil.\nAll the heavenly scriptures are from the creator Lord. There are differences between the prophets but no differentiation. The message is the same: worship Allah, and trust in His all encompassing mercy, as transmitted through His messengers. The true faithful believe in Allah, His messengers, His angels and His books. Please refer to verse 177 of this surah. Islam is a universal religion. (286)\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nWusat means extent or ability with ease. It implies that Allah expects from you as much as you are able to give with ease, for which you have to go to the extent of your potential. It refutes the doctrine of determinism (jabr). Allah does not ask man to do that which is beyond his capacity, nor He does impose a duty to do that which is difficult for him. \"He has not laid upon you in religion any hardship (Al Hajj: 78)\" The Holy Prophet has also said:\n\"I have brought you a very easy religion with a great many facilities.\"\nKasb and its derivatives have been used in the Quran mostly in the meaning of consequences of action, and sometimes for taking into consideration the inclination to do an act. The determinist school wrongly differentiates between the act and what it earns, by saying that \"the act\" is done by Allah but man earns its recompense. This school of thought is unable to explain how the act can be separated from its consequences exactly as the Christians cannot make clear the theory of trinity. \"Do not lay on us a burden (isr) such as You laid on those before us!\" implies that the duties and injunctions for the believers, before the Holy Prophet, were very hard and difficult; and the word isr (burden) also used in verse 157 of al A-raf, carries the undertaking that it will be removed.\nThrough the prayer mentioned in this verse the supplicant prays for the triumph of truth over falsehood and victory of belief over disbelief, and the suppression of satanic tendencies by godliness. It is a prayer to Allah not to inflict on us situations that may result in us committing misdeeds, and to acknowledge our limitations as we expect it from our Lord, provided we work at our maximum capacity, as expected from us; and to rejuvenate us by wiping clean all traces of errors and mistakes; and have mercy on us through pardon (afwu).\nThose who believe in the oneness (Tawhid) of Allah expect from their Lord protection, mercy, guardianship and the ultimate prevalence of true iman throughout the world. This supplication reflects Allah's own laws and promises."

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:2]\nRefer to the commentary of verse 255 of al Baqarah for \"Allah! There is no god save He, the ever-living, the self-subsisting.\" Hayy, the ever-living, and qayyum, the self-subsisting, are the two attributes of Allah which break up and blot out the absurd doctrine of the divinity of Jesus Christ. He, who did not have an existence before his creation, like any other mortal, was brought into being by Allah, therefore, cannot be hayy, the everliving; and also he cannot be qayyum, the self-subsisting, because, according to the Christians, he was crucified.\nIbna Ishaq says that verses 3 to 80 of this surah were revealed about the Christians of Najran whom the Holy Prophet with his Ahl ul Bayt confronted in a spiritual contest known as the event of mubahilah (see commentary of verse 61 of this surah).\nA great deal of metaphysical nonsense, based on conjecture and speculation, is put forward by the Christians in support of their claim, yet they themselves do not understand the doctrine of divinity of Jesus, which they take as true without examination or proof. Moreover, there is no consensus among their theologians. The most popular belief is triune, three in one, or a trinity in unity-God is a spiritual organism, having living components which can be called organs only so long as they remain united and interrelated to each other in the whole, therefore, God is one but has components which perform separate functions. Jesus has a mysterious double nature which makes him a member of the trinity. The idea of trinity or the doctrine of divinity of Jesus was not given by prophet Isa. Please refer to the quotations of the Old and the New Testaments given in the commentary of verse 255 of al Baqarah.\nAll organisms are finite. To function in a harmonious whole the components must be interdependent. There must be an omnipotent will or a primal cause to keep the diverse components together, without being disunited, in order to let them work in harmony. The primal cause is God. None of the components or their whole can be God because they obey and follow the will of the primal cause.\nHayy, the everliving, is He who knows and acts freely without any limitations. Any organism whose components are finite and dependent cannot be an everliving infinite.\nQayyum, the self-subsisting, (a magnified form of the adjective qayam-standing and enduring) is He who stands (subsists) by Himself and all other stand (are subsisted) by His eternal endurance.\nAnything, composed of components with separate functions, is governed by the law of cause and effect; and that which needs reason or cause to be effective or sufficient cannot be self-subsisting, \"Allah is the self-subsisting\" means that to be effective or sufficient He does not need a reason or cause because He Himself is the prime cause. Now it becomes clear that the hypothesis of the scholars and the theologians of the Christian church not only fail to convince the seekers of truth but also create chaos and confusion.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:3]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nTawrat, Injil and the books, mentioned here and in other verses of the Quran, refer to that which was revealed to Musa, Isa and other prophets. Tawrat (the revealed will of Allah) was revealed to Musa. In Hebrew it means light. But the Old Testament is a collection of several other books in addition to the Pentateuch. The four gospels of the New Testament are not the Injil revealed to prophet Isa. These gospels contain only some extracts of the sayings of Isa, and narrate his activities in Galilee, Jerusalem and other habitations of the Jews. The Christian Bible is a book of traditions like the books of traditions written by Muslim, Bukhari and other writers of traditions. These four gospels were written by the followers of Jesus, whom the Christian church proclaims as the apostles. In fact the teaching of Jesus is the gospel, which means glad tidings or good news, because the advent of the last prophet of Allah,\nthe Holy Prophet, was foretold by him, as mentioned in John 14: 16, 17; and 15: 26; and 16: 7 to 13 (see commentary of verse 40 of al Baqarah). The Old and the New Testaments, known as the Bible, is an edited edition of the corrupted and distorted Jewish scripts, prepared to give currency to the doctrine of trinity.\nIt is mentioned in Mark 1: 15 that Jesus asked his disciples to believe in the gospel and preach it to the children of Israel. The gospel referred to by Isa was the Injil, original text of which is not available. On account of theological considerations adhered to by the first council of Venice, the four gospels, written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; are said to be authentic, otherwise there is no historical evidence to support this claim. There were other gospels written by some other disciples but they are treated as apocryphal (spurious) and non-canonic.\nThe Quran is the only uncorrupted book of Allah, containing the true word of Allah in its original purity, revealed to the Holy Prophet, who pronounced it as it was revealed to him, recorded then and there, preserved, never tampered with, and transferred to generation after generation.\nFalsehood cannot come near it from before it nor from behind it. (It is) a revelation from the all-wise, the most praised. (Ha Mim: 42)\nFor kitab see commentary of verse 2 of al Baqarah.\nBil haqq means (with) truth, certainty, reason, justice and proof, in contrast to the false notions and fabricated dogmas of the other corrupted religions and creeds.\nMusaddiqan means the Quran verifies and confirms the preachings of the earlier prophets about the unity of Allah and His demand from man to do good and adopt righteousness.\nFurqan means that which teaches us to distinguish between good and evil, truth and falsehood. It also means salvation. It is another name of the Quran.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:6]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"As He likes\" implies the omnipotence of the divine will. He does what He wills.\nA thorough study of the formation and development of the embryo in any specie, brought into being by the particular protoplasm of its member, proves that it is a carefully designed operation. The way in which the parts of an individual, the members of a specie, and all the species are connected with each other, as the components of the universe, provides sufficient proof that the creator, designer and architect of the whole as well as the components is He, the almighty, the all wise, the one self-subsisting (qayyum), besides whom there is no god.\nSomeone asked Tolstoy:\n\"Do you see the hand of God (a miracle) in the birth of Christ?\"\nHe replied:\n\"I see the hand of God in the birth of every child.\"\nThe hand of God is visible in the working of the whole universe. He is the first, the everlasting, the apparent, the hidden.\nAlthough ordinarily the laws enforced by the will of Allah keep the creation in operation, yet He is not unable to manifest the extraordinary, which the ignorant or the pseudo intellectuals deny, because He has power over all things and He does what He wills. Reproduction by means of an unfertilised ovum is common in insects and bees. If the author of the nature so wills, He can make use of this process in a human being also. So He created Isa without a father. This verse is an introduction to the birth of Isa, narrated in the subsequent verses.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:7]\nAs explained in the commentary of verse 2 of al Baqarah the Quran was revealed to the Holy Prophet. He knew the true meaning of every verse, or after him, it was Ali who claimed that he knew when, why and for whom every verse of the Quran was revealed.\nMost of the verses of the Quran are clear and decisive. There is no ambiguity in them. They are known as the muhkamat. They relate to the fundamentals of the faith, such as the oneness of Allah, the directions pertaining to the practice of the faith and the laws governing the day to day life of the faithful. They can neither be changed nor modified. Any man of average intelligence can understand and follow them.\nThe mutashabihat are the verses which have been composed in subtle and profound diction and style. They carry implications other than the literal meanings, and therefore, are capable of giving different significations, like \"The hand of Allah is on their hands\" in verse 10 of al Fat-h. Verse 1 of al Hud says that the Quran is a book of clear and decisive verses. Verse 23 of al Zumar says that Allah has sent down the very best discourse as a book conformable in its repetition and consimilarity. Only the men of understanding who possess a higher level of intelligence contemplate and find out the meaningful implications of such verses. Average and ordinary minds cannot figure out or have knowledge of the real purport of such verses, and if they try this on their own, they are bewildered and go astray. As mentioned in the commentary of verse 1 of al Baqarah, the huruf muqatta-at are also meaningful but their subtle and profound meanings are known to Allah and His chosen representatives (Muhammad and ali Muhammad) only. Therefore, those who know the true purport of these symbolic letters occupy the highest position in the domain of knowledge and wisdom. In the well-known tradition of thaqalayn the Holy Prophet has clearly made known the fact that whoso remains attached with the Quran and his Ahl ul Bayt, after his departure from this world, will never go astray, because these two weighty authorities will never be separated from each other, and joined together, they shall meet the Holy Prophet at the spring of Kawthar; and \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\", said the Holy Prophet in order to guide the faithfuls so that, to have knowledge of the Quran, they must refer to Ali and his Ahl ul Bayt, who alone know the true meanings of the mutashabihat.\nZaygh means disease, perversity, evil, and wicked intention, the inclination to go against the truth and to blunder, revolt and go astray. Fitna means to create mischief, or to create difference of opinion and to mislead.\n\"None knows its interpretation except Allah and those (who are) firmly rooted in knowledge\", renders null and void all attempts made by scholars to discover the true meanings of the mutashabihat. The firmly rooted in knowledge are those whom Allah Himself gives the knowledge, as verse 49 of al Ankabut says: But it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge. Therefore, the observation of the Ahmadi commentator that reading various passages in the light of each discover the true significance of ambiguous passages, is based upon his inclination to go out of the right course. The Christians also try in vain to assign divinity to Isa by calculating the numerical value of the haruf muqatta-at, and misinterpret the complex verses to suit their dubious theories.\nHow the complex verses can be interpreted is not mentioned in this verse, nor anywhere in the Quran, but it is clearly disclosed that besides Allah only those, endowed with divine knowledge, know the true meanings of the mutashabihat. The firmly rooted in knowledge are the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, the thoroughly purified ones (Ahzab: 33), who possess the desired purity of heart and soul, essential for receiving and holding the truth in order to use it (Waqi-ah: 77 to 79) to do good to themselves and to others. It is obvious that there is no conceivable necessity of revealing complex verses or letter symbols if even the Holy Prophet, to whom the Quran was revealed, did not know their meanings. It is only a hypothetical inquiry, otherwise there is the clear mention of rasikhuna fil ilm (the firmly rooted in knowledge) in this verse, the first among whom is the Holy Prophet, and after him, as said earlier, his Ahlul Bayt are the custodians of his knowledge and wisdom, who alone are entitled to interpret every word of the Quran.\nIn reply to Anas bin Malik's query about rasikhuna fil ilm the Holy Prophet said:\n\"They are those whose hands do not do aught but that which is just, righteous and good; whose tongues do not utter aught but that which is true; whose hearts and minds are enlightened and rational; whose stomachs are free from that which is forbidden.\"\nThe ayah al tat-hir (Ahzab: 33) confirms that only the thoroughly purified Muhammad and ali Muhammad are the rasikhuna fil ilm. Verse 13 of Luqman says that polytheism (shirk) is the most grievous inequity, the worst type of impurity. It is a historical fact that all the companions of the Holy Prophet, before embracing Islam, for a long time in their lives, were idolworshippers. The Holy Prophet, Bibi Fatimah and Ali ibna abi Talib and their children were the only ones who were free from the impurity of polytheism right from the day they were born. All Muslims, in every age, add karamallahu wajhu (Allah graced and honoured his face above others) after the name of Ali, because he never worshipped any ghayrallah (other than Allah). The Holy Prophet pointed out the essential purity of body and soul in Ali, equal to his own purity, when he said:\n\"O Ali! Your flesh is my flesh, your blood is my blood. You and I are from one and the same divine light\"\nVerses 18 of Ali Imran, 162 of al Nisa, 49 of Ankabut, and 11 of al Mujadalah refer to those who have been divinely endowed with knowledge.\nAs ordinary human beings are unable to know the meanings of the mutashabihat, the divine mercy guides the sincere seekers of the truth to turn to the ahladh dhikr, the Holy Prophet and his Ahlul Bayt (see commentary of verse 43 of al Nahl and verse 7 of al Anbiya):\n\"So ask the people of dhikr (the reminder or the Quran) if you do not know.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nNothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah, the self-subsisting, because He is the author of the book of creation (the development of the embryo has been mentioned in the previous verse as an example). In this verse He says that the author of the book of creation is also the author of the book of legislation (the Quran).\nThe book of creation (the universe) contains miscellaneous signs. Some are clear. Some are intricate and perplexing. For example (in the book of creation) the function and the significance of every part of the human structure has been studied and defined except the \"appendix\". Now a rational student of the book of creation will say:\n\"As no part is without some significance, this also must have some meaning, though I have not yet understood it.\"\nOn the contrary a mischief-maker will mix up that which is known with that which is not known and deny both by saying:\n\"As no reason or significance is found in this part, therefore, there is no reason or significance in the whole.\"\nLikewise in the book of legislation, some signs (verses) are clear and decisive (muhkam), and some have several possible meanings (mutashabih), therefore, the rational mind will try to understand the mutashabih (unclear) verses in the light of the muhkam (clear and decisive) verses, by proceeding from the known to the unknown or from the concrete to the abstract; but the perverse mind will judge that which is certainly precise and definite in the light of the complex so as to mislead people by dubious misinterpretations.\nVerse 1 of al Hud says that all the verses of the book are well arranged and firmly established. The arrangement of the words in the verses and the verses in the surahs is so accurate and proper that they all form a consistent unity, though they were separately revealed. It implies that the Quran was already arranged and established before its revelation, which is confirmed by verse 105 of Bani Israil. In verse 23 of al Zumar, the book is presented as consistent, consimilar and conformable in its parts (mutashabihan). But in this verse mutashabihat refers to the meanings, the implications, the connotations and the denotations of the complex passages.\nMuhtam (clear) and mutashabih (complex) are relative terms. What is unclear to some may be apparent and definite to others. There may be quite a few features and viewpoints inherent in certain ideas, or commands, or narrations. Studying them from a particular angle will make their meaning and purpose crystal clear but their clarity may turn into obscurity when they are viewed from another standpoint. At all events, the complex should be examined and interpreted in the light of that which is clear and decisive, or as explained by the Holy Prophet, or by those whose authority has been established by the Holy Prophet and the Quran (see pages 1 to 7, commentary of verses 6 and 7 of al Fatihah, and verses 2, 30 to 37 and 124 of al Baqarah). In the light of verses 16 to 19 of al Qiyamah, the divine agency collects, recites and interprets the Quran. As the book is a guidance for mankind, there should be no unintelligible or incomprehensible passage in it. There is none. As asserted by the Ahlul Bayt, rasikhuna fil ilm is conjuncted with Allah and yaquluna is an adverbial clause qualifying the state of knowledge, referring to rasikhun. In the Nahj al Balagha, Ali ibna abi Talib says that the rasikhuna fil ilm believe in the unknown in the light of the known. As explained in the commentary of verse 3 of al Baqarah the knowledge of the ghayb (unknown) is with the infinite, therefore, the awareness of the finite created beings, even if they are endowed with the divine insight, cannot be at par with the absolute wisdom of the ghayb ul mutlaq, the hayyul qayyum creator. All that which becomes (in obedience) effective, as soon as He wills, is knowable to man. A finite being can know as much as the infinite all-wise likes him to know and grow in knowledge, which implies that basically his knowledge was insufficient but he rises towards the level of perfection, with the help of divine endowment, on his own merits, to become aware of the meanings of all that which has been revealed in the book, because, if it is not so, such revelations (mutashabihat) would be unprofitable and frustrating. So what Imam Ali ibna abi Talib and Imam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir have said in this connection is true.\n"

It was the plan of the pagans to put an end to the new religion of Islam which was uprooting their ignorant and idolatrous life. The Muslims were living under a state of siege, therefore, they were asked to retain their arms while praying (Nisa: 102). Under such adverse circumstances, the almighty Lord inspired the Holy Prophet to make a bold and definite prophecy of the victory of a poorly equipped and helpless few over the vast financial resourcefulness and proven military skill of the allied multitude.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:12]\nThe decisive victory at Badr gave notice of danger to the Jews of Bani Qaniqa who lived in the suburbs of Madina. They wanted to throttle the growing power of the Muslims. They sent a delegation, headed by Kab ibna Ashraf, to Makka to add fuel to the fire of revenge burning in the hearts of the Quraysh and to assure them with their out and out support for the total annihilation of the Muslims. Abu Sufyan went to Madina to enlist the support of the hypocrites who could play a very important role in the overall scheme, hatched against the Muslims, because they were in close contact with the Jews. They had embraced Islam to enjoy the privileges given to the early converts, otherwise at heart they were infidels. They readily joined hands with the intriguer-in-chief, Abu Sufyan, in the house of Salam ibna Mishkan. To revive the old hostilities between the Aus and the Khazraj tribes of Ansars, who had agreed to live in peace after coming into the fold of Islam, was the first objective of the unholy alliance. They took the first step but the Holy Prophet immediately nipped the mischief in the bud. When verse 149 of Ali Imran was revealed the two tribes listened to the Holy Prophet's counsel and remained united.\nAccording to the plan, the Jews began to intimidate the unarmed Muslim men and Muslim women. A typical incident is narrated in the books of history that at a Jew's shop, when a bystander Jew cut off the garment of a Muslim woman, all the Jew spectators laughed at her nakedness. The Holy Prophet came and warned the Jews by reciting this verse. The Jews lost their temper, announced annulment of the treaty they had made with the Holy Prophet, and avowed to prove their strength in the battlefield. At once their forts were besieged. Neither the pagans of Makka, nor their allies (Bani Nadhir and Bani Qurayza), nor the hypocrites could rescue them. Abdullah ibna Obay tried to negotiate a settlement on their behalf. Ultimately the Holy Prophet agreed to set them free on the condition that they should migrate to some far away place. They were allowed to take all their possessions with them. The Holy Prophet had to take such steps to forestall hostile actions against the believers.\n"

It was a decisive victory. The slain on the enemy's side included many of his most influential opponents. Who made this promised victory possible? Ibna Kathir has written that on the day of the battle of Badr, the Holy Prophet gave the standard to his twenty years old brother, Ali ibna abi Talib. Tabari and other historians have said that Ali and Hamza were the only two warriors who not only killed the well-known warriors of the enemy in single combats but also destroyed the enemy's fighting force beyond recovery. For details, study the books of history, in which are also mentioned the names of those who conveniently kept themselves aloof from the fighting on this critical day, described as a sign of Allah, but, after the departure of the Holy Prophet, became rulers to deflect and depart from the true purpose of the religion of Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:14]\nTo understand this verse in its true perspective, the meaning of the phrase \"love or desire of the lust of earthly pleasures\" should be grasped in the light of the teachings of Islam. As Islam does not subscribe to asceticism, lawful use of essential things has not been referred to here. Hubbush shahawati means extreme, reckless and infatuated appetite or passion to own and enjoy things for the sake of possession and enjoyment. Islam teaches man not to get irrationally involved even with lawful possessions. A true believer receives good things lawfully as due return for his labour or services but keeps them in trust with himself, to be distributed as and when commanded by Allah. He is always ready to part with them because he does not attach himself to them in the sense of hubbush shahawati. Being a man he is allowed to desire happiness and satisfaction but is required to keep his feelings and emotions in check to attain moral and spiritual refinement which, in return, enables him to make an offering of his means of satisfaction to the service of the Lord. It is more trying and demanding to control passions than not to have them at all. Total suppression of feelings and desires and mortification of the flesh betrays an escapist tendency to avoid test and trial.\nYou shall not attain to righteousness until you spend (in the way of Allah) of what you love. (Ali Imran: 92)\nThe best example of having good things (property, wives, children, relatives, friends, honour and fame) yet staying detached so as to sacrifice all of them in the way of Allah is found in Karbala. Imam Husayn willingly made an offering of all that which he had to his Lord.\nHe has created life and death that He may try you (to prove) which of you is best in conduct; (Mulk: 2)\nMan has been endowed with life to be tried. In like manner he is tried and tested with family, wealth and other possessions.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThere is an unchanging conflict between the empty and perishable sensuous pleasures and the lasting intellectual and spiritual delight and bliss.\n"

The life of the pious in the spiritual realm either ascends or stays stationary, but never droops. Piety trains the soul to ascend towards perfection in the hereafter.\nThe gardens, the rivers and the purified spouses, promised in this verse, are the minimum recompense that will be made available to the pious, but Allah's pleasure, the most supreme bliss conceivable, is the ultimate destination of the ascension of the human soul for spiritual perfection.\n"

It is His infinite mercy that He makes known His self-subsisting and everliving existence (wajib ul wujud) to His created beings who, otherwise, could never know anything about Him. See commentary of verse 255 of al Baqarah. The finite created beings can only say that there is no god save Allah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn this verse shahadat (bearing witness) has been restricted to Allah, the angels and those endowed with (divine) knowledge, although in many other verses it is stated that every being in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah and bears witness to His unity (tawhid). The restriction is justified because, in this verse, shahadat has been used in the sense of a particular knowledge which contains perceptual insight to realise the truth of His tawhid Allah directly knows that \"there is no god save He\", because He is the known, the knowing and the knower. Those who have attained the perceptual insight of the realisation of truth, by complete mental absorption of the absolute, possess the same quality of knowledge. Whoever reaches this stage naturally becomes entitled to bear witness over His creation. In the Quran such witnesses have been described as shuhada. In verses 41 of al-Nisa and 89 of al Nahl, Allah says that He will call the Holy Prophet as witness over other witnesses.\nFor ulul ilm (those endowed with divine knowledge) see commentary of rasikhuna fil ilm in verse 7 of this surah.\nQa-iman bil qist means that Allah is the vigilant, enduring and (ever) lasting upholder and maintainer of justice.\nAny unjust being, or any being with an iota of iniquity, can never be God, because if arbitrariness had been applied as a primary force to effect and control the universe, no law, physical as well as social, devoid of reason and equity, would be valid and operative. In that case, God could not have an essential existence to be proved by reason, but a contingency that might or might not exist. So it is an imperative fact that absolute justice is ingrained and implanted in the activity of the active factor. Absolute justice, by itself, is one of the aspects of the infinite mercy of the almighty Lord, which regulates and manages His kingdom, the whole universe. It is essentially evident in His every will and act.\nHe has prescribed for Himself mercy, (An-am: 12)\nJustice is one of the 5 fundamental doctrines of Islam-Original, Shi-aism. It distinguishes Shi-a faith from other schools of thought. The 5 roots of the faith (usul al din) are given below:\n(1)Tawhid: There is no god save Allah.\n(2)Adl: Allah is all-just.\n(3)Risalat: The prophets or messengers of Allah, appointed by Him, were truthful, holy and infallible. The last messenger of Allah, the seal of prophethood, is Muhammad al Mustafa.\n(4) Imamat: After the Holy Prophet, the office of the prophethood was terminated, but the divine guidance continued, for which Allah appointed the twelve Imams in the progeny of the Holy Prophet.\n(5) Qiyamat: The day of final judgement.\nFaith in Allah's justice is essential. The laws made by Him to operate the universe are precise and decisive. These are bound by rules based upon justice, and are not arbitrarily changed. That is why there is complete harmony in the working of the whole creation, otherwise there would have been chaos and confusion. All Allah's acts are just and right.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIf qa-iman bil qist is treated as the adverbial clause qualifying the state of ulul ilm (those endowed with knowledge), then grammatically it should have been in plural, therefore, it is true that it qualifies the state of the divine unity. It lays stress on the interrelation between the unity of His essence and His justice, which, as His all embracing attribute, defines and determines His action, and reflects itself in all His attributes. The source of all the attributes manifesting in His justice is the unity of His essence. According to the Holy Prophet the structure of the whole universe stands on the foundation of His justice. So none can perceive Him and His unity unless one upholds and maintains justice. Justice is with unity and unity is with justice. They are correlative and inseparable. Islam teaches us that all excellences flow from the sublime source of justice and all vices proceed from the base root of injustice-see Nisa: 135; Ma-idah: 8; and Hadid :25.\nIn verse 7 of this surah the Quran refers to the decisive verses (muhkamat) as the essence of the book, in the light of which all the other complex verses (mutashabihat) should be interpreted. In view of the interrelation between the unity of His essence and His justice, all the verses in His book of creation and in His book of legislation should be interpreted in a manner which must always be in harmony with the unity of His essence and His justice. The logical method, prescribed by the Quran, is to proceed from the known to the unknown. As the whole universe stands on the basis of the unity and justice of the absolute, it is essential to prescribe justice (adl) as the second article of faith, immediately after tawhid, the first article of faith.\n"

The act of submitting his self by the believer to the will of Allah has been mentioned in verse 112 of al Baqarah and verse 22 of Luqman. The Quran also makes it known that the religion of Islam (submission to the will of Allah) was preached by all the messengers of Allah in the language of the people amongst whom they were sent by Him. Islam is also the natural religion of every human being.\nThe nature (caused by) Allah, in which He has created man.

It is the parents who make him (or her) a Jew or a Christian.\nRight from the beginning, every messenger of Allah preached Islam, but misunderstanding, bias and hatred among the followers of the prophets corrupted the original message.\nAyat means signs. Every prophet and every imam through whom the unity of His essence is proved and made known is His sign. Whoever denies His signs (including the prophets and the imams) is a disbeliever.\nThis verse is also applicable to those who differed after coming into the fold of Islam.\nSee verses 85 to 87 of this surah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIslam is the only religion of Allah. The differences among the various religions and their sects are due to the tendency of revolt against the truth after it has been made known.\n"

A portion of the book, Allah's revealed books in general, was sent down, in all ages, to prepare and train the human soul for the highest level of intelligence and spirituality, at which stage the completed and perfect revelation, the Quran, was revealed to the Holy Prophet, referred to as the book of Allah in this verse.\nProphet Isa had also informed the people that there was still much that he could say to the people, but the burden would be too great for them then. He also added: \"When he comes who is the spirit of truth, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but will tell only what he hears; and he will make known to you the things that are coming.\" See John 16: 12 and 13.\nIt is reported that in the early days of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet, a married man of large means was caught while committing adultery with a woman. The Jewish priests did not want to punish them by stoning to death as prescribed in the law of Musa. Presuming that the Holy Prophet did not know their scripture, they referred the case to him so that the culprits could avoid the punishment by his misjudgement. The Holy Prophet announced the correct judgement in the light of the Tawrat but the Jews persisted that it was not in their book. The Holy Prophet asked them to bring their own distorted edition of the Tawrat. Even in their corrupted version Leviticus 20: 10 to 21 confirmed the decree pronounced by the Holy Prophet. Yet they did not agree and arrogantly persisted in their point of view.\nIn John 8: 4 to 7 it is stated that an adulteress should be stoned according to the law of Moses but Jesus had said: Let he who has not sinned stone her. This is a clear example of unauthorised addition because Isa himself announced: Do not suppose that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to complete. I tell you this: so long as heaven and earth endure, not a letter, not a stroke, will disappear from the law until all that must happen has happened. (Matthew 5: 17, 18).\nAnd Musa has said: You shall keep all my rules and my laws and carry them out. (Leviticus 20 : 22).\nAccording to their books Isa could not amend the law of Musa. Holy Quran says that Isa had the authority to amend the law of Musa (see verses 50 and 51 of this surah), but he did not change this law because verse 2 of al Nur confirms it.\nThe adulterer and the adulteress-scourge you each of them (with) a hundred stripes.\nIt is related in Safi that once the Holy Prophet went to a school of the Jews. In reply to their question he said that he followed the religion of Ibrahim. \"But Ibrahim was a Jew\", said the Jews.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:26]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nSovereignty belongs to Allah; He is the sole and the ultimate authority in the domains of creation and legislation. Every thing submits to the authority of the master of the universe, the absolute sovereign, because all things in the universe have been created by Him, and therefore, Islam, the only religion of Allah and the only means of salvation, stands for total submission to Allah's will-a truism candidly summed up in these verses in the form of a prayer. The Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt have rightly advised the faithfuls to recite this prayer at all occasions, so that the conviction in the omnipotence of the almighty permeates their hearts and minds to guide them in all their mental and physical activities. A complete resignation to Allah's will is possible only when man believes that it is Allah who alone can do and undo things, conceivable and inconceivable, easy and difficult. Then the grace of the merciful Lord abounds, because in His hand is all good. He is the absolute sovereign. None has any right or claim upon Allah. He bestows His bounties on whomsoever He likes. There should be no complaint, nor grudge, nor frustration. With total resignation to His will, man must pray and invoke His mercy to obtain fulfilment of his legitimate wants and needs. Ibna Abbas says that these verses contain the ism al azam, the greatest name of Allah, therefore, its recitation for obtaining fulfilment of desires brings positive results, provided that in thoughts and deeds the supplicant wholeheartedly relies upon Allah's omnipotence and judgement, and remains thankful in all events and under all circumstances. Nothing is impossible for Him.\nAn usurper or a tyrant, by actual control of the machinery of government, may become a defacto ruler. The Nimruds and the Fir-awns were defacto rulers. They also claimed divinity. A large number of people accepted them as gods, but none of them was a de jure God. The theoreticians, in the employment of the usurpers and tyrants, try to misguide the people by arguing that a de facto wielder of power is also a de jure ruler. It is a fact that there are some chosen representatives of Allah who, by right, are entitled to exercise the authority, given to them by Allah Himself, which they do as the de jure authorities (Baqarah: 247; Nisa: 54, Munafiqun: 8), although the defacto kingdom may be in the hands of others who are rightly described as usurpers in the political thought of true and original Islam.\nYazid bin Mu-awiyah, the de facto ruler, argued with the Ahl ul Bayt by quoting this verse that he was also the de jure authority. Bibi Zaynab binta Ali proved his deceitful claim false by showing the inherent weakness in the theory of fatalism. In her analytical, objective, and rational discourse she quoted verse 178 of Ali Imran and verse 10 of al Rum to establish the fact that those who disbelieve, imagine that the rein Allah gives them does good to them, whereas, truly Allah gives them rein that they may grow in sinfulness, for which there is a disgraceful punishment for them, because evil is the consequence to those who deal in evil by denying the signs of Allah and making a mockery of them.\nThe chosen representatives of Allah, His signs, are the real authorities to administer God's kingdom, because of their total submission to Allah's will (Baqarah: 247; Nisa: 54 and Munafiqun: 8). To enable the true faithfuls to identify the rightful inheritors of God's kingdom, an extract from the prayer of Imam Ali bin Husayn al Zaynal Abidin is given below:\nO my Allah, this office (administration of the God's kingdom) belongs to the leaders appointed by Thee, Thy chosen friends, because it was founded and preserved for Thy fearless trustees, who have been particularly elected to execute this highest function, but Thy representatives have been wronged by the usurpers, every trick is used to harass them and to snatch from them their rights, again and again intimidated and exposed to dangers. Thy book has been thrown to the winds, commandments made obligatory by Thee have been falsified and put out of context, and Thy prophet's way of life has been discontinued and discarded. Why? Thou knows best.\n(Du-a al Jumu-ah-Sahifa al Kamilah)\nIf the theory of might is right is accepted then usurpation will have no meaning at all.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:28]\nThe polytheists who worship false deities stand opposite to those who believe in one true God. There cannot be any friendship between them because friendship is built upon the foundation of mutual love. Love is a very active force. Love between two individuals, more often than not, exercises impending influence upon each other's habits, thoughts and feelings. Due to this active phenomenon in human nature, tawallah, love of the Ahl ul Bayt (Shura: 23), has been prescribed as one of the fundamentals of original Islam- Shi-aism, because he who loves the Ahl ul Bayt will accept their teachings, follow their guidance, and reflect their qualities in his character. In the case of friendship between a monotheist and a polytheist, the strict monotheist, under a state of attachment and love, may lose his sense of reasoning and begin to like idolatry, and in the end become a practising idol-worshipper. Therefore the believers have been warned not to take the unbelievers as friends.\nAwliya is the plural of wali which implies nearness, proximity, contiguity, therefore, it can be used for any of the following: friend, beloved, helper, protector, patron, administrator and master.\nIn a multilateral political and economic structure the believers are allowed to deal with them as human beings and live in harmony with them in day to day life. Only love or attachment has been prohibited. The provision of \"except when, fearing a danger from them, you (have to) guard yourselves against them\" is a very important guideline in this verse. If there is a genuine danger to life, permission is given to make a show of friendship with the adversary, remaining faithful to the true faith at heart. To guard oneself against an unprovoked danger to life in a helpless situation, or to avoid dishonour and ostracism, is known as taqiyah in the Shi-a school of thought, prescribed strictly in the light of this verse, because Allah does not want to make less the number of His true believers if there is no occasion or need of their lives to be sacrificed to further His cause and mission. They are allowed to live and serve Him in secret.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq (according to a Sunni tradition) is reported to have said that \"Allah warns you to beware of Him\" implies \"Allah knows all that which is in the heart, and He wants to see only His love in the hearts, therefore, He warns the people not to allow anything except His love to take possession of their hearts.\"\nHeart is given to man to fill it with the love of God. If love of anything or any person, except love of those enjoined by Allah (Shura: 23), is lodged therein it would be judged as a misappropriation on the day of reckoning.\nSee Aqa Mahdi Puya's note in verse 31 of this surah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAccording to the doctrine of taqiyah under certain circumstances a faithful can make friends with his adversary to save his life and property, otherwise friendship between a believer and an unbeliever is prohibited because it would make the believer drift in the direction of unbelief.\nTaqiyah means to hide one's faith to protect one's life and property in the interest of the faith, permissible according to this verse (see books of fiqh). Nifaq means to pretend to believe what one actually does not believe for worldly gains (Nahl: 106), condemned in the Holy Quran again and again.\nAllah's pleasure should be the object of hiding or making known that which is in one's heart.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:31]\nLove of Allah is the basis and essence of Islam. Fear is not the motivating factor, because one who worships Him and obeys His commands out of fear, devoid of love for His grace, comes in the category of idolworshippers who worship the false deities to appease their anger. See the commentary of rahman and rahim in surah al Fatihah and know that the heathen syndrome has been destroyed and replaced with love, kindness and compassion by the religion of Allah, Islam. The phrase \"God-fearing\" actually means guarding oneself against evil with awareness of the boundaries laid down by Allah. Man must refrain from thinking or acting in a way which may hurt the feelings of the beloved whom he intensely loves, reveres and worships.\nIt is made clear in this verse that he who loves Allah must follow the Holy Prophet. Sincere following of the Holy Prophet in the day to day life is the only proof of the love of Allah, otherwise it is an empty claim. Allah loves the true followers of the Holy Prophet and forgives their sins.\nOne who loves his beloved also loves those whom his beloved loves, therefore, every sincere follower of Islam (Allah's lover) must love the Holy Prophet and those whom he loves. There are several authentic traditions reported in the books of history written by Muslim scholars, referred to in the commentary of many verses in this book, according to which the Holy Prophet had openly declared his exclusive love for Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn and their children; and in verse 23 of al Shura love of the Ahl ul Bayt has been enjoined on all the true believers. In fact those who do not love the Ahl ul Bayt are not the believers, therefore, the doctrine of tawalla is one of the fundamentals of the true faith, Islam original or Shi-aism.\nLikewise, in the light of verse 28 of this surah, it is the duty of every Muslim to avoid and dislike the enemies and the allies and friends of the enemies of the Holy Prophet, because a believer cannot be a friend of those who hated and opposed the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt. Therefore, the doctrine of tabarra is also one of the fundamentals of the true faith, Shi-aism.\nThe love of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt makes man follow in their footsteps, which, in fact, is the love of Allah. Those who oppose them and follow their enemies go against Allah and His commandments.\nA true lover of Allah becomes a devotee of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, and mindful of the life after death, his true love activates him to always do that which pleases Allah, the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, and refrain from acts of wickedness which certainly displease them; moreover, he remains attached with the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt and refrains from going near their ungodly enemies, be they his own kith and kin.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAccording to An-am: 50;Araf: 203;Yunus: 15; Ahqaf: 9 and Najm: 3 and 4, since the Holy Prophet only followed the divine will, therefore, following in his footsteps is the only proof of the love of Allah, which alone entitles man to receive Allah's love. Any deviation from his word or deed means the deviator not only loses Allah's love but also earns His displeasure.\nAli ibna abi Talib has said:\nThe words and deeds of the Holy Prophet, from the beginning to the end of his stay in this world, were the truest demonstration of the divine revelations (nothing but a revelation revealed), and I did not follow any save him.\nTherefore, Ali was the beloved of Allah and His prophet because he loved Allah and His prophet.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:33]\nIn this verse Adam and Nuh are mentioned by their names, whereas Ibrahim and Imran are mentioned with reference to their posterity. Al (the posterity) of Adam and Nuh have not been included in the category of the chosen ones, because there were several ungodly and wicked persons in their lineage, but in the al (immediate issues) of Ibrahim (Ismail and Is-haq) and Imran (Musa and Harun), holy men of God, were chosen as messengers of Allah.\nThe mention of Ibrahim and Imran, undisputedly amongst the holiest prophets of Allah, has been made in this verse with reference to their posterity, because according to the religious annotation, in the word al the spiritual quality of a posterity automatically includes the immediate ancestor or the founder of a family. Al or Ahl ul Bayt, commonly used to address the members of a family, is exclusively reserved, in the religious and spiritual act of referring, for the holiest members of the family of the Holy Prophet who are identical with each other in their personal purity and spiritual sanctity (Ahzab: 33).\nThe Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt are in the posterity of Ibrahim, therefore, in the light of this verse, they are chosen in preference to all the created beings. They are superior to every human being. (Tafsir Durr al Manthur; and Mawahib al Ladunniya).\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIt has been proved beyond doubt that he who submits to Allah's will (becomes a Muslim) has to love Allah, His Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, then only he will be able to follow the sunnah (way of life) of the Holy Prophet, without which he cannot be a Muslim.\nWhat is prophethood? How is a prophet selected or chosen? To know that prophethood is bestowed by a proper course of divine selection in which heredity plays a great part, the following observations should be carefully studied and understood.\n(1) In strict compliance with the divine plan, every created being finds itself in the place it deserves in the arc of descent (downward journey from the absolute to the rudimentary matter) as well as in the arc of ascent (return upward journey from the rudimentary matter to the absolute).\n(2) Therefore, selection means putting each particle of the universe in the proper place it deserves in the management of existence.\n(3) The rudimentary matter, through the process of qualitative change, can take the form of a being, but each of the diverse forms it takes differs from the other in the combined effect of the aptitude and competency it bears. The solar system is a complex and intricate form of matter, yet all its parts or portions do not have the same ability as the earth does, nor do all the parts or portions of the earth carry the capacity to take the form of a living thing, nor do the parts or portions which carry the capacity to take the form of a living thing can become a human being; and likewise, the parts or portions which have the potential of becoming human beings do not necessarily produce men of superior quality. The part or portion of the matter which has the potential to take the form of a superior human being was selected for Adam. The process of creation is the same but, as education is a process of selection by means of which the latent mental capacities are awakened and used for higher purposes, the men of superior quality and character are made to emerge from that part or portion of the matter which has the potential to become a human being.\n(4) It is necessary that the part or portion which has the potential of producing the superior-most human beings should not be contaminated in the course of its development whilst passing through the parental channels. Therefore, vigilant care by the divine agency has to carry the purity and refinement of this superiority through the selected lineage at all stages, till it reaches the desired destination. The Holy Quran refers here to this process of selection and choice of a particular lineage for risalat and imamat. It starts from Adam and passes through Nuh to Ibrahim. After Ibrahim it was bifurcated in his two sons, Ismail and Is-haq. The descendants of Ismail are known as ali Ibrahim, and the descendants of Is-haq are called ali Imran. The selection of the line of ali Imran for prophethood was terminated after Isa whose birth, disappearance (Allah raised him alive to the heaven) and promised re-appearance (at the end of this world before the day of resurrection) are the signs (miracles) of Allah; but the line of ali Ibrahim, through Ismail, remained chosen till Abd al Muttalib, and then again bifurcated through Abdullah and Abu Talib. Muhammad al Mustafa was the son of Abdullah and Ali al Murtada was the son of Abu Talib. When Ali and Bibi Fatimah, the daughter of the Holy Prophet, were joined in the holy matrimony, the line of Ibrahim continued in their progeny:\nImam Hasan bin Ali al Mujtaba\nImam Husayn bin Ali al Shahid al Shuhada\nImam Ali bin Husayn al Zayn al Abidin\nImam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq\nImam Musa bin Jafar al Kazim\nImam Ali bin Musa al Rida\nImam Muhammad bin Ali al Taqi\nImam Ali bin Muhammad al Naqi\nImam Hasan bin Ali al Askari\nImam Muhammad bin Hasan al Mahdi\nThe disappearance and the promised re-appearance of the living Iman al Mahdi resembles the disappearance and the promised re-appearance of Isa; both are examples for the house of Ismail and the house of Israil respectively (Zukhruf: 59). When both of them will re-appear at the end of the world, before the day of resurrection, prophet Isa will follow Imam Muhammad al Mahdi, and the whole mankind will follow them.\nAllah chose Adam, Nuh, ali Ibrahim and ali Imran in preference to others for appointing His messengers and guides. It is a selection from the descendants of Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim and Imran, because all their children did not have the superior quality to represent Allah.\nThe Holy Prophet has said:\nAllah selected Adam in preference to all other creatures; from among the descendants of Adam, He selected Nuh; from among the descendants of Nuh, He selected Ibrahim; from among the descendants of Ibrahim, He selected Ismail; from among the Quraysh, He selected Hashim. All of them carried my nur (the first light which came forth from the absolute and goes on till the day of resurrection to manifest ultimately in the arc of ascent). It passed through Abd al Muttalib to Abdullah and Abu Talib. I am from Abdullah and Ali is from Abu Talib. Ali and I are one and the same nur.\nDhurriyatan ba-duha min ba-din, in the next verse, excludes any possibility of including the followers in al, as some commentators try to do by comparing the word al used here with al used in ali Fir-awn, the followers of Fir-awn. Here, heredity is the essential basis of choosing a person for risalat, therefore, no follower can be included in the ali Muhammad (Ahl ul Bayt) for conferring the office of imamat. To acknowledge the excellence of Salman the Holy Prophet bestowed on him the highest honour of belonging to the select group of the Ahl ul Bayt but as he was not an offspring of the Holy Prophet, he could not be appointed as an Imam. In spite of her piety and righteousness Ummi Salimah was not considered one of the Ahl ul Bayt though suitable appreciation by the Holy Prophet consoled her. Some of his other wives also coveted for the inclusion but were refused without even a consolation.\nThe Holy Prophet, his ancestors and his descendants (ali Muhammad) are ali Ibrahim (Baqarah: 124, 128, 129; Ibrahim: 37). They were the descendants of Ismail. The descendants of Is-haq are also ali Ibrahim. Ali Imran may refer to Imran, the father of Musa and Harun, or to Imran, the father of Maryam, mother of Isa. Here ali Ibrahim also includes Ibrahim, as Musa and Harun are included in ali Musa and ali Harun in verse 248 of al Baqarah.\n"

See commentary of Baqarah: 124 and 125 wherein the text of Genesis 12: 2 and 3; Genesis 16: 9 to 11;and Genesis 17: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 20 has been quoted.\nThe Holy Prophet has said:\n(1) I and Ali are of one and the same light.\n(2) Ali is a part of me and I am a part of Ali.\n(3) The root of Ali and me is the same, but all other people come from various other origins.\n(Zaynul Fata; Ibna Maghazali; Shafa-i; Kanzul Ummal, Ahmad ibna Hanbal).\nThe statement in these two verses, referring to the past, is a declaration of what has already taken place as a partial realisation of the divine will, and is a promised prophecy of its perfection when it refers to the future. Islam was the religion of Ibrahim, but it was completed and perfected through the Holy Prophet (Ma-idah: 3), and was continued in its pristine purity through Ali and his posterity which is the posterity of the Holy Prophet. In Genesis 17: 20 it is mentioned that Allah promised Ibrahim: He will multiply Ismail's descendants and he (Ismail) shall be father of twelve princes)-twelve Imams in the posterity of Ibrahim, Ismail and the Holy Prophet, from Ali ibna abi Talib to Muhammad bin Hasan al Mahdi, offsprings, one from the other.\nAlso see commentary of the previous verse for \"offspring, one from the other\".\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:35]\nAn extract from Burckhardt's lectures on Syrian church is quoted below:\nDevotees to the temple in the Jewish creed remained as recluses, cut off from worldly life, and practised celibacy. Imran the father of Mary (the mother of Jesus) seems evidently to be of priestly descent. This factor is borne out from the vow which his wife makes about her issue in her womb to dedicate it to the service of God. It is reasonably considered that it is possible that because of the vowful will of his grandmother that her issue be dedicated to God's service, i.e., as a devotee to the temple, Jesus adopted the ascetic mode of life. Otherwise he had great respect for married life.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe word imra-at means wife when related to a personal noun, but alone it means a woman. In this verse it is related to Imran, therefore, means wife of Imran. As usual, to create confusion and deny miracles associated with the prophets of Allah, the Ahmadi commentator has translated imra-at as \"woman\" in order to twist and obscure the meanings of the words of this verse.\nThere are three persons named Imran:\n(1) The father of Musa and Harun.\n(2) The father of Maryam (grandfather of Isa).\n(3) The father of Ali, the paternal uncle of the Holy Prophet, known as Abu Talib.\nImran, the father of Maryam, is referred to in this verse, not Imran, the father of Musa and Harun. There is a long period of time between Musa and Isa, therefore, some of the Christian scholars wrongly conclude that the Quran and the Holy Prophet (God forbid) made a mistake by stating that the mother of Maryam is the sister of Musa. The Holy Prophet knew well that between Musa and Isa there were several prophets of Allah- Dawud, Sulayman, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya. Isa was the last prophet of the children of Israil, after whom none was sent as a prophet of Allah save Ahmad, the Holy Prophet himself, a fact recorded in Deuteronomy 18: 18, 19;John 4: 16; 15: 26; 16: 7, 8, 12, 13.\nMuharraran means freed or liberated. Here it means freed from worldly attachments, and therefore devoted to Allah's service.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:36]\nWhen a female was born, Hanna, wife of Imran, was disappointed, because she had vowed to dedicate her son to the service of Allah, as it was a custom in those days to give one of the sons over to the temple in Jerusalem. Yet she named her daughter Maryam which, in Hebrew, means \"maid-servant of God\"; and brought her to the sanctuary. The priests unwillingly accepted Maryam on Hanna's plea that her daughter was assigned by her to God's service before her birth. She entrusted her daughter and her offspring (Isa) to Allah and invoked Him to keep both of them safe from satanic influence. Zakariyya, husband of Hanna's sister, and Maryam's maternal uncle, was chosen by casting lots to take charge of Maryam. As soon as she reached the age of puberty, he erected a high balcony where she used to stay the whole day, praying; and in the evening, he used to take her with him to her abode. The room in which she slept and lived during the night was always locked and its key was kept with him.\nIbna Hajjar and Abu Dawud relate that once the Holy Prophet visited Bibi Fatimah, took some water in his hand from a wooden cup, sprinkled it over her head and shoulders, and repeated the exact words of Hanna's prayer, revealed in this verse.\nIn fulfilment of the Holy Prophet's prayer, Bibi Fatimah was chosen by Allah as the superior most woman of the worlds, and eleven divinely commissioned guides (Imams) were born in her posterity.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:37]\nThe desire of Hanna was fulfilled in Isa. The miraculous birth of Isa was a clear sign of the omnipotent will of Allah. As the creator of the laws of nature, He does not depend on their operation because whatever takes place in nature is an immediate effect of His will (see commentary of verse 6 of this surah).\nWhenever Zakariyya came to see Maryam in the sanctuary, he found her provided with fresh fruits and eatables from heaven. This naturally excited wonder in him, since none could enter her locked chamber except himself. He used to ask, \"Where has this come from?\" And always she replied, \"From Allah who gives food in abundance to whomsoever He likes\".\nIt is clear from this verse that she received food from Allah direct, miraculously, without the intervention of any physical agency (yarzuqu man yasha), therefore, the misinterpretation of the Ahmadi commentator that the food might be the offerings of the worshippers is ridiculously mischievous, because, in reality, the worshippers could not meet Maryam without Zakariyya's knowledge who was the only person who could open the locked door to let them in. The Ahmadi commentator not only slanders Maryam but also tries to present Zakariyya, a prophet of Allah, as a fool who wonders every time (kullama) he sees the food near Maryam. It is an attempt to bring the prophets and the chosen friends of Allah to the (low) level of the false prophet of Qadiyan.\nShaykh Sadi says:\nThe beauty of Yusuf, the breath of Isa (whereby he resuscitated the dead), the white hand of Musa, those excellences they had separately, you (O Muhammad) alone have all of them.\nMiracles, similar to those that took place in the lives of the prophets separately, were repeated by the Holy Prophet.\nIt is written in \"Anwar al Tanzil\", \"Kashshaf\" and \"Malim al Tanzil\" (the books accepted as the most authentic by Sunni scholars) that sometimes the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt had to go without food. On such a day the Holy Prophet went to his daughter and asked for some food. She had no food to give to her father. For the last three days she, her husband and her children had nothing in the house to eat. Fatimah stood on her prayer-mat and invoked Allah to help her so that she could serve food to her father. Suddenly steam began to come out from the vessels lying empty in the kitchen. After removing the lids, she found the best kinds of food in them. She brought the food and told her father:\n\"It is from Allah, who gives food in abundance to whomsoever He likes.\"\n\"Glory be to Allah. He has given you food as He had given to Maryam\" said the Holy Prophet.\nNot only the whole family ate the food but it was also distributed amongst the neighbours.\n"

In verse 171 of al Nisa also, Isa has been described as a word of Allah, which refers to his birth from a virgin mother, a unique distinction, because he was born at the command of Allah, when He said: \"Be\". Allah does what He wills. He can create a being by making amendments in the laws of nature, created by Himself, which always obey His will.\nA single word may have a meaningful implication. Isa is the kalimah of Allah. The Holy Prophet is referred to as dhikr (reminder) in verse 10 of al Talaq.\nThe Ahmadi commentator quotes An-am: 34; Yunus: 64; Kahf: 27, 109; Luqman: 27 and Tahrim: 12 to interpret kalimah as prophecy, but he intentionally avoids to mention Ali Imran: 44 and Nisa: 171 where kalimah has been used to describe Isa as the \"word of Allah\".\nYahya (John) was the cousin of Isa, six months older than Isa, who was the first person to believe in Isa as a true prophet of Allah, sent to revive the faithful practice of the law of Musa. Yahya was killed before Isa's ascension to the heavens.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe phrase bi-kalimatin used here as a common noun (nakirah-indefinite) shows that Isa is not the only kalimah (or the only \"word\", in this sense, from Allah) but there are more and he is one of them.\n"

In verse 47 of this surah he translates anna as \"how\". Although in both these verses anna (how) signifies the sense of surprise and indicates the events of the births of Isa and Yahya as miracles effected by the will of Allah, the Ahmadi commentator, in this verse, inserts a wrong word, and in verse 47, after translating anna as \"how\" puts forward lame arguments to deny Maryam's virginity (see commentary of verse 47 of this surah). The statement that \"Allah does whatsoever He wills\" settles irrevocably the birth of Yahya as a definite miracle.\n\"But they had no children, for Elizabeth (Zakariyya's wife) was barren, and both were well on in years. Zachariah said to the angel: How can I be sure of this? I am old and my wife is well on in years. (Luke 1: 7 and 18)\nQad balaghaniyal kibaru (when indeed old age has overtaken me) is not a conjunctive clause. It is an adverbial subordinate to the principal clause. The word wa, used on two occasions in this verse, means \"while\", not \"and\", otherwise the answer would not correspond to the question, clearly suggesting surprise. If it was to mean what the Ahmadi commentator thinks, the answer should have been mahma yasha instead of ma yasha, because in answer to a question about time \"whatsoever\" (the way in which) cannot be used.\n"

It is wrong to translate la tukallima as \"you should not speak.\" \"You will not speak\" is the true translation as explained by Aqa Mahdi Puya in the following note.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn reply to Zakariyya's request for a sign which could let him know that his wife was blessed with a child, the almighty Lord gave him the sign that he would not be able to talk to the people whilst being fully occupied with remembrance and praise and glorification of Allah, day and night. The command was to remember Allah and glorify Him all the time. So it was obvious that a prophet of Allah, while carrying out his Lord's command, would not find time to speak to the people at all, otherwise there was no restriction on uttering words from the mouth. Praise and glorification of Allah takes man into the pure domain of spiritualism through which he overcomes physical disabilities and obstacles, and obtains grace and blessings of Allah. The laws of nature, known to man, can be controlled, modified or altered by the spiritual and divine agency.\nIt is said that through the science of hypnosis the will of the living being can be controlled, then how can one deny the superior power of the spirit which can effect any change in any natural phenomenon?\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:42]\nThe position of Bibi Fatimah as the superior-most woman in the universe has been acknowledged by all the Muslim scholars (please refer to Mishkat al Masabih bab al manaqib), therefore, the following note of Aqa Mahdi Puya should be carefully studied.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe first istafaki (selection of Maryam) refers to her apostolical lineage (in the seed of Ibrahim) and her purification. The second istafaki refers to the fact that she was chosen to become the mother of a prophet without a father, remaining a virgin therefore, up to her time and till the advent of the Holy Prophet, she was the best of the women in the worlds. The Holy Prophet has declared that Bibi Fatimah is the chief of the women in the universe; (because) Bibi Fatimah was the daughter of the superior most prophet of Allah, the seal of prophethood; and the wife of an Imam who alone has the unique distinction of, \"Ali's flesh is my flesh, Ali's blood in my blood, and I and he are from the same divine light\" (saying of the Holy Prophet), and the mother of eleven holy Imams and through her last son the divine will and justice shall prevail on the earth, and the son of Maryam, Isa, shall follow him. Through verse 33 of Al Ahzab, she, Ali and their sons have been thoroughly purified. Therefore, (as the Holy Prophet has declared) Maryam was chosen and her status remained so till his daughter Fatimah was born and thereafter Fatimah is the most blessed, thoroughly purified, and the choicest woman, the best of all the women in the universe from beginning to the end, in all ages, among whom are included Asiyah, Maryam, and Khadijah al Kubrah.\nOn account of the charges levelled against Maryam by the Jews, her status has been made clear in this verse, but in view of her thorough purification in verse 33 of al Ahzab and the declaration of the Holy Prophet, whose spoken words are as absolute and true as the word of Allah in the light of verses 2 and 3 of al Najm, no one could, and did not, question the character and the status of Bibi Fatimah; therefore, there was no need to mention her, as no ambiguity or slander ever existed concerning her sublime character. The Holy Prophet's words are enough to establish her as the superior most woman among all the women in the universe for all times.\nMuhammad Iqbal, known as the philosopher- poet of the east, accepted as a scholar of great depth and vision by all the Muslims, has given his opinion about Fatimah Zahra in the light of the historical facts mentioned in the books of Islamic history. He says:\nMaryam, of one connection with Isa, is venerable; (but) for three relationships Fatimah is revered, respected and glorified; she is the light of the eyes (dearest darling daughter) of the \"mercy unto the worlds\", the leader of those who have gone by and of those who will come; she is the wife of he who wears the crown of Hal-Ata (Surah al Dahr), the chosen, the divine helper, the fearless overpowering strength of Allah; she is the mother of the axis of the circle of love and devotion, the leader-in-chief of the caravan of lovers and devotees (Hasan and Husayn).\n"

There was no means of knowing the dispute among the priests of the sanctuary as to who should have Maryam in his charge (because the accurate records of these events have been obliterated altogether) except by revelation. The Holy Prophet knew about the casting of lots to select Zakariyya to take charge of Maryam, as if he was there when this event took place.\nImam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir has related that Abd al Muttalib, the grandfather of the Holy Prophet, had nine sons, and he had vowed that if a (tenth) son was born he would sacrifice him in the name of Allah. Then Abdullah, the father of the Holy Prophet, was born, and to fulfil his vow he made preparations to sacrifice him in the name of Allah, but his friends and relatives requested him to ascertain if camels could be sacrificed in Abdullah's place, by casting lots, as was done to select Zakariyya to take charge of Maryam. In the first casting of lots (ten camels against the life of Abdullah) the name of Abdullah appeared. The casting of lots was repeated eight times by adding 10 more camels every time, and on all occasions it was Abdullah who was selected, but at the tenth time, with 100 camels, the casting of lots chose the sacrifice of 100 camels in place of Abdullah. Abd al Muttalib repeated the casting of lots with 100 camels thrice and received the same answer. Then he was satisfied that Allah wanted to spare the life of Abdullah (the father of the Holy Prophet). The Holy Prophet used to say: \"I am the sons of two sacrifices-Ismail and Abdullah.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe prophets of Allah did not know the unseen, the unknown, or the unknowable through ordinary means, unless the knowledge of the ghayb (the knowledge of the past, right from the beginning of creation and the events of the future which would take place in this world and in the hereafter) was revealed to them as much as Allah wills; therefore it is stated in this verse that Allah informs the Holy Prophet about the ghayb through revelation to know not only that which was unknowable through ordinary means but also that which was knowable through regular media.\n"

Further, to deny the miraculous birth of Isa, he finds a father for him, totally ignoring the clear mention of \"Isa son of Maryam\" as mentioned in this verse and the miraculous birth of Adam and Hawwa without parents, since he wants to bring down the chosen prophets of Allah to the ordinary level of the man whom he (the Ahmadi translator) proclaims as the Messiah.

It is a miracle. The Ahmadi commentator, avoiding deliberately with malafide the miraculous life of Isa, says that it was an ordinary child's talk, having no sense or meaning.

There is no room for translating anna as \"when\" in both the events. Lam yamsasni basharun (when no man has touched me) clearly shows that the news of the forthcoming birth of Isa was given to Maryam in her state of virginity, which was going to take place without the agency of a male partner, suspending the natural process necessary for a woman to conceive a child.\nAs stated in the preceding verse the Ahmadi commentator overlooks and takes no notice of the clear words of this verse and makes desperate attempts to put forward his outlandish theory that though the Quran does not mention the name of Isa's father but as Maryam had other children (the four gospels in which this is stated are inauthentic and come in the category of folklore, therefore, should be rejected in view of the verses of the Quran) there should have been a man who had begotten Isa. By stating that Maryam was not a virgin he belies verses 42, 45, 46 and 47 Of this surah and verses 17 to 22 of Maryam wherein it is clearly mentioned that Isa was a gift from Allah given to Maryam when she, surprised, asks the angel: \"How can there be a son (born) to me when no man has touched me?\" In between the lines the Ahmadi commentator has tried to tell the Muslims that the reporting of the Quran is incredible, therefore, false, and Maryam's statement (lam yamsasni basharun) is a lie, which has not been exposed in the Quran because Allah does not know what she had been doing secretly. The reasons for this mischief-making has been given in the commentary of the preceding verses 45 and 46.\nOne of the reasons for revealing these verses was to counter and squash doubts and misgivings that people may have and express so as not to believe in the possibility of the birth of a child (Isa) to a virgin female (Maryam) without a male partner, otherwise if Isa was to be born in the ordinary course of nature, there should have been no necessity to mention these events at all.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe religion of Allah, Islam, emphatically states that Maryam, the mother of Isa, was a virgin. She did not have any kind of sexual relation with any man before or after the birth of Isa and remained a virgin in the strict sense of the word till she departed from this world, as has been mentioned in verse 12 of al Tahrim that Maryam, the daughter of Imran, guarded her chastity, and Allah breathed into her His spirit (Isa), and she was an obedient servant of Allah, and she testified the truth of the words of her Lord-she neither lied nor kept anything hidden, because, as Allah says, she was truthful.\nKadhalikallahu yakhlaqu ma yasha (even so Allah creates whatsoever He wills) refers to the process of creation in which the principal active factor is His will or command-Ali ibna abi Talib has said that kun (be) is not a sound or voice which the ear receives and hears, but Allah's word is His work which takes effect at once whenever He wills.\nIn this sense every creature is the result of His creative word or the manifestation of the imperative word kun (be); therefore, every creature is the word of Allah.

All the Muslims know and acknowledge that the Holy Prophet, the seal of prophethood, is the superior-most prophet of Allah, the chief of all the prophets, whose advent has been continuously promised by Allah long before the birth of Isa-see Deuteronomy 18: 5, 15, 18 and 19 text of which has been mentioned in the commentary of al Baqarah: 253, wherein is also mentioned that which Isa said about the advent of the Holy Prophet (the comforter, the spirit of truth) John: 14: 16, 17; 15: 26; 16: 7 to 13.\nIs there any sense in saying that the Holy Prophet was an illiterate who acquired whatever learning he had from ordinary mortals, when Isa came into this world endowed with divine knowledge? Please refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 78. All Muslims should feel ashamed to believe in the lie that the Holy Prophet took fright at the sight of angel Jibrail on the mountain of Hira; he returned home scared stiff; his wife, Khadija al Kubra, consoled him and took him to Warqa bin Nawfil, a Christian, who informed him that prophethood had been bestowed on him, because it was not a devil that he saw on the mountain of Hira but an angel.

Please refer to Matthew 15: 22 to 26 wherein it is also stated that Isa had declared: \"I was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israil, and to them alone\". As per Matthew 10: 5 and 6, Isa commanded his twelve disciples:\n\"Do not take the road to gentile lands, and do not enter a Samaritan town; but go to the lost sheep of the house of Israil (to proclaim the message)\".\nModern Christian scholars have to acknowledge the advice of Isa, and his earliest disciples, not to treat his message as universal.\n\"The earlier group of disciples, it is true, did not appreciate the universality of the teaching of Jesus, nor did Jesus seek converts outside Israil\".\n(Encyclopaedia Britannica 29 volumes 11th edition-London)\nA miracle (a credential of prophethood) is an extraordinary occurrence which cannot be produced by any natural agency but only by the direct will of Allah. It may be either above natural law or contrary to it or else independent of it. Once the existence of a \"wajib ul wujud\" (Allah) is proved as a fact (see commentary of al Baqarah: 255) there is no a priori impediment in believing that He can perform whatever He wills in any manner that He deems fit and necessary. The possibility of miracles can never be questioned by a theist, because a miracle is only an exercise of free-will on the part of the creator and author of the creation with all its laws-a fulfilment of His purpose in a way that appears novel to the onlookers (who can never know that which He knows and controls). It does sometimes happen that the public mind is led to the acceptance of the divine truths not by any rational arguments or moral and spiritual evidence but only by the miraculous manifestations of the divine power at the hands of His approved and appointed representatives to generate conviction in men of average intelligence. So Isa, by Allah's permission, formed, of clay, a thing like a bird and breathed in to it (and Allah made the thing alive), cured blindness and leprosy, put life into the dead and told the people their most secret affairs. Matthew 8: 3, 9 : 18, 19, 23 to 25, 27 to 30; and Mark 8: 22 to 25; and Luke 7 :12 to 15; Luke 17: 12 to 14; and John 9: 1 to 7, 11:11 to 44 refer to the miracles mentioned in this verse. As has been said in the commentary of verse 3 of this surah, the four gospels of the New Testament are not the Injil revealed to Isa but a collection of traditions pertaining to Isa, referring to his activities in Galilee, Jerusalem and other habitations of the Jews; therefore, it is not free from the bias, pride and prejudice of the writers of the four gospels. The Jews and the Christians were always in a state of hostility. Blasphemies have been invented and false reporting made by both of them to glorify their heroes and discredit other's leaders. So whatever is mentioned in their books of traditions cannot be true, and that which has been omitted cannot be rejected as false. For example, the turning of water into wine for a marriage party by Isa, mentioned as the first miracle of Isa, is, by all standards, a fabricated story; or the way in which Isa is reported to have rebuked his mother: \"Woman ! what have I to do with you\". How can a prophet of Allah say such words to his mother whom Allah had chosen and purified? The Old and the New Testaments are a mixture of truth and falsehood. The Quran, the Holy Prophet and his holy Ahlul Bayt have correctly presented Isa as the holy spirit of Allah and as an infallible prophet of Allah. (See notes \"The Tawrat\" and \"The Injil\" at the end of al Ma-idah).\nIn the days of Isa the people to whom he was particularly sent (the Jews) could not be effectively convinced with the help of arguments based on reason because of their ready inclination to believe in anything which confounded their raw and undeveloped intelligence. For example, magic and witchcraft excited their imagination. More often than not, they responded to suggestions made through either of them, therefore, the purpose of the miraculous manifestation of the divine powers at his hands was to make them believe in him and in that which he preached, as the prophet of Allah. The Holy Prophet, in theory and practice, was endowed with the extraordinary power to perform all or any of the miracles manifested by all the prophets, from Adam to Isa. The Holy Prophet did not have to resort to miracles on account of the following reasons:\n(1) His matchless and ideal character before announcing his ministry-His life in Makka convinced the people, among whom he was sent, that he was trustworthy and truthful; therefore, they used to address him as al-amin and al-sadiq.\n(2) His noble lineage-he was a direct descendant of prophet Ibrahim.\n(3) He had an everlasting miracle with him-the Quran.\nAnd if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant (Muhammad), then produce a surah like it; and call on your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.\nBut if you do not do it and you will never do it, then, safeguard yourselves with full awareness of divine laws from the fire whose fuel is men and stones-prepared for the unbelievers. (Al Baqarah: 23 and 24)\n(4) The Holy Prophet, the last messenger of Allah was commissioned to convey the final divine message and to invite the people to worship one Allah, at a time when the human mind was on the threshold of the era of finding out truth through reason and contemplation. The human mind was ready to listen to rational arguments and reflect, think and judge. Awesome and wondrous manifestations, to bring home to people the truth, were a thing of the past. So the Holy Prophet, in spite of having all the powers to manifest miracles, called mankind unto the way of the Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation (words of good advice), and reasoned with the people in the best way, as has been asked by the Lord in verse 125 of al Nahl.\nAs stated in al Baqarah: 118 (Please refer to its commentary) not only the Holy Prophet, but also the divinely chosen Imams had performed miracles, whenever they deemed it necessary and thought that it would serve a useful purpose, but refused to put them to use as an answer to the challenge of any antagonistic individual or group, who even after witnessing the same would not accept the truth.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIt is logical to conclude (after rejecting the concocted insinuation of motivated reporters of the traditions, that the Holy Prophet was illiterate, an unimaginable defamation of a prophet of Allah, but held as true by the majority of his followers, except shias) that when Isa, a follower of the Holy Prophet, sent only to the children of Bani Israil, was taught the book and the wisdom by Allah Himself, the Holy Prophet, who came to guide and warn the whole mankind, in all ages, must have been and, in fact, was thoroughly purified from the dirt of ignorance, and was endowed with divine wisdom, and knew not only to read and write but had total and complete knowledge of the book of creation, the book of legislation and all the holy scriptures revealed to other prophets before him. The Holy Quran, in verses 1 to 4 of al Rahman, says that the rahman Himself not only taught the rahmatun lil alamin the entire process of creation but also blessed him with the faculties of appropriating knowledge and giving expression to that which he was taught, with complete and perfect control. Although the ultimate agent for giving shape or character to a thing, in the domains of creation and legislation, is the will of Allah, yet His approved intermediaries are also allowed to take action. Therefore it was neither blasphemy nor transgressing the limits when Isa said: \"I will create a bird, out of clay, for you\", or \"I will heal the blind and the leper\", or \"I will raise the dead\", because he did all that he said by Allah's permission. On the other hand, it is a blasphemy to belie the person on whom Allah has bestowed such powers, or to whom He has delegated His authority to act on His behalf. According to verse 69 of al Nahl there is healing for mankind in that which comes out from the abdomen of the bee (honey). So, there is no wonder, if the soil of Karbala, the resting place of His devotee, Imam Husayn, is used to cure and heal many a disease (known as khaki shifa). What has been given to whom by Him can be found out by referring to authentic sources.\n"

See James 2: 19; John 20: 17;Timothy (1) 2: 5; Jude 25.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAccording to verse 50, Isa had the authority to repeal or amend the laws of Musa, therefore, he cancelled some of the laws of Tawrat, but, in the New Testament, a saying of Isa is reported that: mountains may move but not a word from the Tawrat will be removed. The Quran presents Isa as a law-giver prophet. He asks people to obey him and follow his orders in addition to the testament that they already had. He also asks them to adhere to the right path which implies that adherence is not following a particular legislation but strict compliance with all the laws issued by Allah.\nWhoever obeys the laws laid down by the succeeding prophets, in fact, carries out the orders of the preceding prophets, but if one only gives allegiance to the previous prophets and rejects the orders of those prophets who came after, in reality, renounces all the prophets. This applies also to the commandments of Allah. If one obeys Him throughout his life but revolts in the last moments of his life, he will be cursed, as Iblis (Shaytan) was condemned for ever. On the other hand, if one surrenders to Him in obedience and sincerely in the dying hours of his life, his past sins may be forgiven.\n"

Hawariyyun refers to the disciples of Isa, who were usually dressed in white garments, or to those who were deputed by Isa to preach the unity of Allah, the true gospel. In both cases it may also refer to the purity of their hearts.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nMan ansari (who will be my helpers unto Allah?) corresponds to an identical event known as dawat al ashirah. When the verse \"And warn your tribe of near relatives\" was revealed, the Holy Prophet asked Ali to invite the tribe of his near relatives at the house of Abu Talib. Before the leaders of the Quraysh, like Isa, he said:\n\"O kinsmen! By Allah, I and I alone can offer you the most precious of gifts, the good of this world and of the hereafter. Allah has commanded me to call you to that which is the best-His worship.\nI, therefore, call upon you to come forward and testify to my prophethood. Who among you will help me and join me in my task, and be my brother, my lieutenant, my vicegerent and my successor?\"\nAli was the only person who came forward in response to the call of the Holy Prophet. Then and there the Holy Prophet declared:\n\"Verily Ali is my brother, my vicegerent and my successor. From this day it has been made obligatory upon every one to obey the superior authority of Ali.\"\n(See page 4).\nThe above event and address have been recorded by a large number of notable scholars and prominent traditionists in their books, for example, Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abu Hatam, Ibn Marduwayh and Abu Na'im, and Bayhaqi, who has recorded it in both of his books, Sunan and Dala'il, and Tha'labi and Tabari in their great commentaries of surah al-Shu'ara'. Tabari has recorded this also in his Tarikh al-Umam wa al-Muluk (i.e. the history of the various people and their rulers), Vol. 2, p. 217, in somewhat different words, and Ibn Athir has recorded this among the traditions universally accepted to be genuine in his Tarikh al Kamil Vol 2, p. 22, under the caption \"Allah ordered His messenger to declare his messengership.\" Abd al-Fida has recorded this event in Vol. 1, p. 116 of his book on history in connection with the account of the person who was the first to embrace Islam, and Abu Jafar al-Iskafi Mu'tazali has recorded it in his book Naqd al-Uthmaniyyah and fully explained its authenticity, as mentioned in Sharh al-Nahj al-Balagha, vol. 3, p. 263, by Ibn Abi Hadid, printed in Egypt. As regards the book Naqd al-Uthmaniyya it is really matchless. The author has thoroughly discussed everything connected with the Prophet's invitation in vol. 3, pp. 257-281, in his comments on the concluding portion of Khutbah al-Qasiah.\nHalabi has recorded it in his famous Sirah al-Halabiyah where he has described it in the chapter on the hiding of the Holy Prophet and his companions in the house of Araqam. Please refer to vol. 1, p. 381. The reckless narration of the event and indiscriminate comments thereon by Ibn Taymiyah deserve no attention because of his well-known party spirit, for this event has been recorded even by the socialist writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal of Egypt, who has described the event at length in his magazine Al-Siyasah no. 2751, p. 5, col. 2, published on 12 Dhil-Qadah. 1350 A.H. If you refer to no. 2785 of the said magazine, p. 6, col. 4, you will find that he (Mr. Haykal) has recorded this tradition (i.e., the address) on the authority of Muslim's Sahih, Ahmad's Musnad, Abdullah ibn Ahmad's Ziyadat al-Musnad, Ibn Hajar Makki's Jami'al-Fawaid, Ibn Qutaybah's Ayun al-Akhbar, Ahmad ibn Abd Rabbuh's Aqd al-Farid, Umar ibn Bahr al-Hajiz's pamphlet Banu Hashim and Abu Ishaq al-Tha'labi's commentary of the Quran.\nIn view of the importance and universal fame of this tradition, many European writers (the French, the English and the German, etc.) have mentioned this tradition in their books, and Thomas Carlyle has also mentioned this briefly in his Heroes and Hero Worship.\nBesides the above, many notable scholars and traditionists have recorded this tradition in their books with some difference in words but no difference in implication, e.g., Tahawi, Diya Maqdasi in his Mukhtarah, Said ibn Mansur in his Sunan, etc. However, sufficient for our purpose is the tradition recorded by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who has related the tradition from Ali in his Musnad, vol. 1, pp 111 and 159. He has recorded in Musnad, Vol. 1, beginning of p. 331, another important tradition from Ibn Abbas that enumerates ten such characteristics of Ali which distinguish him from all others; Nasai has also quoted this from Ibn Abbas in his Khasais al Alawiyah (distinguishing qualities of Ali), p. 6; Hakam has recorded it in his Mustadrak, Vol. 3, p. 132, and al-Dhahabi in his Talkhis (abridged edition) of Mustadrak. He has also admitted the genuineness of the tradition. In Kanz al-Ummal, vol. 6, the event has been related at length.\nIf you will refer to Muntakhabi (selections from) Kanz al-Ummal, which has been printed on the margin of Musnad of Ahmad and peruse the contents of the margins of vol. 5, pp. 41-43, you will find the tradition in its details. This one event of warning to the kinsfolk and the address by the Holy Prophet alone, which has been recorded by almost all the scholars, historians or traditionists, amply prove that the imamat and khilafat were the right of Ali.\nWhat Ali undertook that day, successfully and truly, was carried out through out his life.\nIn verse 52, the devoted disciples of Isa bear witness that they have surrendered themselves to His will. In verse 53 they pray for attaining the quality of the witness referred to in verse 17 of al Hud, which refers to the Holy Prophet as a clear sign of Allah and to Ali as a witness, a guide and a mercy, from Allah. The Holy Prophet's declarations (\"I and Ali are from one and the same divine light\" and \"Ali is from me and I am from Ali\") are based upon this verse and verse 61 of this surah, through which Ali has been established as the sole \"self\" (nafs) of the Holy Prophet. See Sahih Bukhari, chapter \"manaqib\".\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:55]\nAs stated in verses 45 to 47 of this surah (please refer to their commentary) the birth of Isa was a miracle. His departure from this world to the heaven, alive, was also a miracle. It is stated in Minhaj al Sadiqin that Isa was kept in custody in a room during the night following which he was to be crucified in the morning. At daybreak, Judas the hypocrite companion of Isa, who had betrayed him to the Roman soldiers, went into the room to escort Isa to the place of crucifixion. As soon as he entered the room, he was miraculously transformed into a person who resembled Isa. When he came out of the room the Roman soldiers took him to the cross and crucified him, in spite of his loud and desperate protestations.\nIn Badshah Husain's English translation of the Holy Quran, Sale is quoted on page 14 of Vol. 11. as under:\n\"It is supposed by several that this story was an original of Mohammad's but they are certainly mistaken, for several sectarians held the same opinion, long before his time. The Basilidians (Irrenus I.I.C 23 and C. Epiphan Haeres 24 num III) in the very beginning of Christianity, denied that Christ himself suffered, but that Simon the Cyraracean was crucified in his place. The Corinthians before them and the Carpocratians next (to name no more of those who affirmed Jesus to have been a mere man) did believe the same thing; it was not himself, but one of his followers very like him that was crucified. Photius tells us that he read a book entitled \"The Journeys of the Apostles\", relating the acts of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas and Paul, and among other things contained therein, this was one, that Christ was not crucified, but another in his stead, and that therefore he laughed at his crucifiers (Photius Bible Cod 114, col. 291) or those who thought they had crucified him (Tolands' Nazrenus p. 17 and c.)\"\nThe Jewish plot to kill Isa was prevented by the best of planners, the almighty Allah.\nTawaffa is to fulfil a promise. Inni mutawaffika means \"I will complete your term\". The word may mean death or to take away. It has been used in both its meanings in the Quran. The Ahmadi commentator, to deny the miraculous escape of Isa from being crucified, misinterprets the word tawaffa as Isa's physical death. The Holy Prophet and the holy Imams have said that Isa will come down again from the heaven before the day of resurrection and offer prayers behind Imam Muhammad al Mahdi, the last Imam in the progeny of the Holy Prophet.\n\"And set those who follow you (victorious) above those who disbelieve\", refers to those Christians who accepted Isa as a true prophet of Allah, followed his teachings, and believed in his prophecy about the advent of the Holy Prophet. See Genesis 17: 7, 8, 20; Acts 3: 22 to 25; John 1: 19 to 21; 14: 16, 17, 26; 15:26; 16:7 to 13. The true believers in Isa, were Muslims. Those who believe in Isa as a son of God or God are infidels.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe incoherent recording of the events of Isa's crucifixion, burial and resurrection in the New Testament, proves that the whole story had been fabricated to suit the doctrines of the Christian church. Paul had distorted the true faith of Isa to accommodate Roman paganism. Their story should be judged in the light of the following analysis:\n(1) Those who came to arrest Isa, in the darkness of night, had never seen his face.\n(2) It was Judas who, standing beside Isa, identified him.\n(3) Judas' features were very much like Isa's.\n(4) As the light was very dim, their faces could not be seen clearly.\n(5) The soldiers were afraid of the people, who certainly would have started a struggle at any moment and made their task difficult, so they were in a great hurry.\n(6) It was Judas who was crucified.\n(7) The crucified body was brought down from the cross in the early hours of dawn.\n(8) The disciples ran away from the scene and did not witness the burial.\n(9) The grave, in which the crucified body was buried, was found empty.\n(10) The only witness of the resurrection was Mary Magdalene whose versions, given in the four gospels, differ from each other. In some, she was there when Isa rose from the grave; and in some, when she approached the grave, she was told by another unknown witness that her Lord was raised to heaven.\n(11) Isa was seen by the disciples after the resurrection\nIt is a fact that it was not Isa who was crucified. He was saved. His disciples gave currency to the idea of his crucifixion so that the Jews remained assured of his death, else they would have gone in his pursuit. The Roman soldiers also kept quiet in order to avoid the blame of killing a wrong person and also the certain punishment for not executing Isa. As Sale has observed in his above noted explanation, the early Christians did not believe in Isa's crucifixion.\nAll the Muslims, in the light of this and other verses of the Quran, do not give any credence to the false story of Isa's crucifixion and resurrection, fabricated by the Christian church.\nTawaffa (to take away), tahar (to purify), raf-a (to raise) and nuzul (to descend) are the four effects of the divine will in connection with Isa, out of which the first three have already taken place and the fourth is expected to happen, before the final resurrection. The religion of Allah shall triumph over all other religions and creeds. The light of truth shall enlighten the world, and a perfect human society shall be established before the world comes to an end. This is His promise. If tawaffa means death, then also there should be no doubt in the mind of a believer about Isa's nuzul because, as said in verses 258 to 260 of al Baqarah, Allah can give life to the dead or raise up any dead living being to life. In the opinion of Shaykh Saduq, this explanation is more credible.\nIf tawaffa means departure from this world without dying, then his nuzul will be re-appearance after his temporary disappearance, similar to Imam Muhammad al Mahdi, who is living on the earth as a necessary link between man and God, while Isa has been raised up unto Allah. So Isa has no jurisdiction in the matters of this world, whereas Imam Mahdi is the sole deputy of Allah to look after and take care of the terrestrial affairs. When both of them shall re-appear Isa shall follow the leadership of Imam al Mahdi.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:59]\nThe Christians of Najran came to the Holy Prophet and asked him as to why he had been abusing Jesus (Isa) by saying that he was a man created by God, when he was born without a father. The Holy prophet told them that he could not abuse Isa as he was the \"word of Allah\" communicated through a purified virgin, Maryam, but the reason (birth of a man without a father) put forward by them to accept him as a son of God or God was untenable because Allah created Adam without a father and a mother.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe process of creation has been discussed in verses 6 and 37 of this surah according to which Allah's will is the principal factor in the process of creation. The birth of Isa to a virgin mother, without a male partner, was an immediate effect of His will, manifested to the world as a miracle, just as the birth of Adam took place without the agency of a father and a mother. When He wills a thing to \"be\", it becomes. Even in the theory of evolution there comes a stage, while backtracking, when one has to accept the fact that a living being must have come into being without the agency of a sexual procedure. Whatever once happened in the process of creation can take place any time, may be once in a great while but not altogether impossible. There are several examples in nature, which are inexplicable through any law known to man. The only explanation, as the Quran points out, is the imperative word of Allah. As has been stated in the commentary of verse 6 of this surah, the hand of Allah is visible in the working of the whole universe.\nThe likeness of Isa with Allah is as the likeness of Adam. Therefore, as the Christian church argues, if Isa was a son of God because he was born without a father, Adam deserved more to be God or son of God as he came into being without a father and a mother .\nThe creation of Isa has been compared to the creation of Adam, the first human being. There would be no point in comparing Isa to a (universal) man as the Ahmadi commentator conveys has been done in this verse.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:61]\nThis verse refers to the well-known event of mubahilah mentioned in every book of history, traditions and tafsir written by Muslim scholars.\nThe Holy Prophet was sending invitations to all to accept the true religion of Allah. Tribe after tribe, region after region, were coming into the fold of Islam. One such invitation was sent to the Christians of Najran, a town in Yemen, in the 9th year of Hijra. A deputation of 60 scholars came to discuss the matter with the Holy Prophet. Abdul Masih, the chief monk, asked him as to who was the father of Isa, thinking that the Holy Prophet would accept (God as the father of Isa. Verse 59 of this surah was revealed and presented to the Christians as a reply but they did not listen to reason. Then this verse was revealed to call them to a spiritual contest by invoking the curse of Allah on the liars mubahilah. The Christians agreed to this contest.\nEarly next morning, the 24th of the month of Dhilhijjah, the Holy Prophet sent Salman to the selected site, outside the city area, to set up a shelter for those whom he would take with him, as his sons, women and selves.\nA large number of companions assembled in the masjid, making themselves available for the selection. On the opposite side of the field, selected for the contest, the Christians, with their selected men, women and children appeared on the scene.\nAt the appointed hour, a huge crowd, standing in wait, saw the Holy Prophet coming in, Imam Husayn in his arms, Imam Hasan holding his index finger, walking beside him, Bibi Fatimah Zahra, close to his heels and Imam Ali just behind her-as his sons, women, and selves. It should be noted that although there was provision for \"women\" and \"selves\" the Holy Prophet selected one \"woman\" and one \"self\"-Fatimah and Ali, because there was no woman and no man among his followers at that time who could be brought into the contest of invoking the curse of Allah on the liars. They alone were the truthful ones. (see commentary of al Tawbah: 119).\nThe Holy Prophet raised his hands to the heaven and said:\n\"O my Lord! These are the people of my house\".\nThe chief monk looked up and down at the faces of the Pure Five (Panjatan Pak), from whom emanated a radiant and brilliant glow; and this sight filled him with awe and anguish. He cried out aloud:\n\"By Jesus! I see the faces that if they turn upward to the heavens and pray, the mountains shall move. Believers in Jesus of Nazareth, I tell you the truth. Should you fail to come to some agreement with Muhammad, he, along with the godly souls with him, shall wipe out your existence for ever, should they invoke the curse of God on you.\"\nThe Christians saw the wisdom of their chief and readily agreed to arrive at a settlement. As there is no compulsion in religion (Baqarah 256), the Holy Prophet gave them complete freedom to practise their faith. He also agreed to protect their lives and possessions; and for this service the Christians consented to pay a nominal fee (Jizya). It was an extraordinary manifestation of the glory of Islam; therefore, the followers of Muhammad and ali Muhammad celebrate this unique blessings of Allah (bestowed on the Ahl ul Bayt) as a \"thanksgiving\" occasion of great joy and comfort.\nMany Muslim scholars, commentators and traditionists whom the ummah acclaim with one voice, have given the details of this event with following conclusions:\n(1) The seriousness of the occasion demanded absolute purity, physical as well as spiritual, to take part in the fateful event.\n(2) Only the best of Allah's creations (the Ahl ul Bayt) were selected by the Holy Prophet under Allah's guidance.\n(3) It, beyond all doubts, established the purity, the truthfulness and the sublime holiness of the Ahl ul Bayt.\n(4) It also unquestionably confirmed as to who were the members of the family of the Holy Prophet.\n(References:- Mahmud bin Umar Zamakhshari in al Khashshaf; Fakhr al Din al Razi in Tafsir Kabir; Jalal al Din al Suyuti in Tafsir Durr al Manthur; Tafsir Baydawi; Tafsir Nafsi; Tafsir Ibna Kathir; Sahih al Muslim and Sahih al Tirmidhi.)\nA very large number of Muslims (and also nonmuslims) witnessed the contest and came to know that Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn were the \"Ahlul Bayt\" addressed in verse 33 of al Ahzab, known as ayah al tat-hir or the verse of purification.\nIn this verse, the divine command allows the Holy prophet to take with him \"sons\", \"women\" and \"selves\"; therefore, had there been \"women\" and \"selves\" worthy to be selected for this symbolic contest, among his companions, he would certainly have selected them, but as it was seen by one and all, only Fatimah and Ali (and their two sons) were chosen, because none of the anxiously waiting companions (among whom were the three caliphs and the wives of the Holy Prophet) was truthful or so thoroughly purified as to deserve selection for an event which was divinely decreed in order to also make known the true successors of the Holy Prophet.\nThe word anfus is the plural of nafs which means soul or self. When used in relation to an individual, it implies another being of the same identity with complete unity in equality; therefore, one is the true reflection of the other in thought, action and status, to the extent that at any occasion or for any purpose, any one of them can represent the other. Even if the word nafs is interpreted as \"the people\", it is clear that Ali alone is \"the people\" of the Holy Prophet.\nAfter the departure of the Holy Prophet, within a year, the symbolic event of mubahilah was ignored by his followers. The house of Fatimah was set on fire. A well-known companion kicked the door of her house which fell on her. The injury caused by the falling door finally killed her. In view of the following saying (Sahih Bukhari-Vol. 2, page 206) of the Holy Prophet her killer stands condemned for ever:\n\"Fatimah is my flesh and blood, whoso causes suffering to her in fact causes suffering to me. He who has pained me in fact has pained Allah; and, indeed, he is a disbeliever\", said the Holy Prophet in the light of verse 57 of al Ahzab.\nIt happened when a large crowd under the leadership of the above said companion came to arrest Ali ibna abi Talib, the nafs of the Holy Prophet, his brother, his vicegerent and his successor, who was deprived of his rightful mission to administer the affairs of the ummah, after the Holy Prophet, so as to enable some to distort and corrupt the true religion of Allah and utilise its name to enforce tyranny, injustice and ignorance of the pagan days. Finally Ali was killed in the masjid of Kufa when he was praying the fajr salat. Imam Hasan was killed by a deadly poison administered by a woman hired by Mu-awiyah bin Abu Sufyan. Imam Husayn, along with his friends and relatives, was killed in the desert of Karbala, by the army of Yazid bin Mu-awiyah, and the ladies and the children of the house of the Holy Prophet were held captive, taken from town to town, tortured and harassed. The body of the martyred Imam was left unburied for several days. The perpetrators of this tyranny and injustice were those who had seen with their own eyes Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn going to the contest with the Holy Prophet as his sons on the day of mabahilah.\nThe followers of the Ahlul Bayt are on the path of truth, and their enemies are the upholders of falsehood, but strangely so, those who follow the true path are described as dissenters, and on this basis have been harassed, persecuted and killed by those who denied, belied and ignored not only the ayah al mabahilah and ayah al tat-hir but also many such verses of the Quran and clear traditions of the Holy Prophet. The followers of the Ahl ul Bayt have been suffering death and destruction on account of their adherence to the true path, at the hands of the enemies of the Holy Prophet and his holy Ahl ul Bayt, yet they never give up their faith because neither they longed for worldly possessions nor they feared death and destruction, in the true tradition of their Imams.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n(1) When reason and facts failed to convince the opponents, the medium of mubahilah (prayer to curse the liars) had to be used. It was a test of the truthfulness of the persons chosen to establish the truth and carry out the divine mission.\n(2) The nearest and the dearest have to be exposed to danger.\n(3) The nearest and the dearest of a prophet (who has devoted himself and whatever belonged to him to Allah and has been purified from all likes and dislikes based upon self interest, mundane desires and carnal passions) must naturally be of his class and quality in devotion and purification.\n(4) According to verse 46 of al Ahzab the Holy Prophet was a summoner unto Allah by His permission; therefore, it was not his choice but Allah's will to summon a certain class of people to invoke the curse of Allah on the liars.\n(5) Right from the commencement of his mission to the last moment of his departure from this world, the Holy Prophet called only Ali on all important occasions.\n(a) He called the ten year old Ali at the time of making known his mission.\n(b) At the time of inviting his tribe to the worship of one Allah, it was the thirteen year old Ali who gave answer to the call of the last prophet of Allah.\n(c) At the time of migration from Makka to Madina, he called Ali and asked him to lie down on his bed to face his enemies, who had planned to kill him during that night, and Ali wholeheartedly agreed to give his life to save the messenger of Allah.\n(d) It was Ali, who was designated, as his executor of wil1, to return the deposits entrusted by the residents of Makka to the al-amin prophet after the Holy Prophet migrated to Madina.\n(e) In the battle of Badr, Ali was asked by him to fight and repulse the hordes of enemy soldiers when many of his companions were quietly watching the fighting from a safe distance.\n(f) In the battle of Uhad, when the enemy had an upper hand and the danger to the Holy Prophet's life was imminent, because all his companions had run away from the battlefield and disappeared, it was Ali who stood by the Holy Prophet and brought to naught all the plans of the enemy.\n(g) In the battle of Khundaq, Ali was called, as the embodiment of faith to fight against the incarnation of disbelief, Amr bin Abdwud, to win victory for the disheartened Muslims.\n(h) In Khaybar, when all the companions of the Holy Prophet tried and failed to subdue the enemy, Ali was called to come to the rescue of the deficient and depressed Muslims and conquer the fort of Khaybar single-handedly.\n(i) At the time of going to Tabuk, the Holy Prophet designated Ali, as his vicegerent, to take charge of the affairs in Madina, saying that Ali was to him as Harun was to Musa.\n(j) Ali was called to preach the verses of al Barat which contain complete disassociation from idolatry, because only he or the Holy Prophet, according to the command of Allah, were competent to convey them to the people (on account of exact similarity or equality between the two). So Ali went to Makka and relieved Abu Bakr who had earlier been sent to do this job.\nAli, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn, the four thoroughly purified members of the chosen group, were the \"selves\" of the Holy Prophet, but Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Ali, as abna-ana (sons), and Fatimah, the wife of Ali, as nisa-ana (women) and Ali himself as anfusana (selves) came out to represent the party of Allah. In Sahih Muslim it is mentioned that at the time of coming out from the canopy, the Holy Prophet looked skyward and said:\n\"O my Lord, these are my Ahl ul Bayt.\"\nEven Ibna Hazm, a staunch advocate of the Umayyid point of view, has stated that at the time of mubahilah, only Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn came out with the Holy Prophet to take part in the contest.\nThe enemies of the Ahlul Bayt, true to their policy of ignoring the matchless symbolic glory of the Ahlul Bayt, either have not referred to this event at all, or, in order to play down its fundamental role in determining the true faith, have made evasive attempts to give misleading meanings to some of the words of this verse, such as saying that in Arabic literature nisa has not been used for daughters. It is obvious that their knowledge about the Quran is very limited. In verses 7 to 11 of al Nisa, nisa has been used to refer to daughters. Moreover, Fatimah, in addition to her relationship to the Holy Prophet as his daughter, was also chosen as the wife of Ali, who is the self or soul of the Holy Prophet, in which case the significance of anfusana becomes more subtle, because no wife of the other constituent of anfusana (the Holy Prophet) was found competent to take part in the spiritual contest. In verse 5 of al Tahrim, the almighty Allah says that if the Holy Prophet divorces his wives, the Lord will give him in their stead, wives better than them, which implies that there were women better than his wives, but there was none better than the \"pure five\", or even equal to them, who could be chosen to become one of the glorious group selected for the mubahilah in spite of the latitude accorded by the plurality permitted by the all-wise Allah. Please refer to the commentary of verse 33 of al Ahzab to ascertain that Ummi Salimah and A-isha so much desired to be taken under the blanket but were refused by the Holy Prophet.\nIf the bat (a flying mammal) does not like the sunlight, never shall the beauty of the sunshine become dim. Likewise, if the enemies of the Ahlul Bayt try to distort the facts of history, they shall never be able to tarnish the ever bright source of enlightenment and glory which shall radiate its divinely endowed splendour till eternity.\nIn spite of the fact that one woman, one man and two boys were chosen, the plural number is used here, because in this holy house, males and females of the class of this divinely chosen group were born to face the challenge of falsehood in the same manner and style. In Karbala, when falsehood incarnate, in its utmost wickedness, challenged the truth from Allah, Imam Husayn, the surviving member of this group, along with the souls, sons, wives and daughters of this holy house, brought down the curse of Allah upon the liars and their followers, and thus truth won an everlasting victory over falsehood.\nIn the light of Ahzab: 33, Ali Imran: 61 and Tawbah: 119, Ali ibna abi Talib has said:\nI am the sidiq al akbar (the greatest truthful). I am the faruq al azam (the greatest distinguisher between truth and falsehood). He who claims any of these titles (other than me) is the greatest liar.\nThere was no genuine sidiq al akbar among the Holy Prophet's companions (save Ali), otherwise he would have been selected to accompany him at the time of mubahilah.\nAli was ten years old at the commencement of the Holy Prophet's mission and thirteen at the time of dawat al ashira, and on the occasion of mubahilah, Imam Hasan was six and Imam Husayn was five years old, yet the Lord commanded his messenger to select them for His cause and purpose as He had found in these particular children that which He had noticed in Isa, because of which He bestowed prophethood on him and gave him the book and the wisdom when he was but a baby in the cradle. Although, ordinarily, intellectual maturity, which does not develop fully in children, is essential to shoulder any kind of responsibility, the"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:64]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Holy Prophet, while preaching the truth, adhered to the policy of peace and rational adjustment with the non-Muslims. The original scriptures of the Jews and the Christians also preached monotheism. See commentary of al Baqarah: 255. Even the corrupted editions of the Old and the New Testaments contain the truth in Exodus 20: l to 4; Deut 6: 4; Isaiah 42: 8, 44: 6-45: 5, 18, 21, 22-48: 12; (1) Corinthians 8: 4, 6; Ephesians 4: 5, 6. The worship of human-gods crept into their religion when they began to consider their rabbis and monks and Isa to be as gods, apart from Allah (see Tawbah: 30 and 31). Therefore, in this verse, the Jews and the Christians are invited to agree to worship none save Allah and not to associate anything with Him, which is a common doctrine between them and the Muslims. If they do not agree, the Muslims have been asked not to accommodate them in any way, since their false faith could contaminate the pure monotheism that the Muslims believe in and hold dear to their hearts.\nFrom the beginning of this chapter the Quran refers to the unity of God (tawhid), not only as the creator but also as the absolute sovereign of all that has been created by Him (and everything has been created by Him), unto whose legislative will all have to submit. Every one must obey Him, revere Him, and worship Him.\nAll the created beings, on the earth and in the heavens and in between them (may be some of them are superior to others) are His slaves, servants and subordinates. To associate any thing, in any way, as a separate authority, with Him is polytheism (shirk). \"There is no god save Allah\" is the divine declaration. All the followers of the heavenly scriptures have been commanded, after giving undeniable proofs that all the prophets including Musa and Isa were the created beings, to base their views and doctrines on this fundamental principle. The views and the theories laid down by any individual or by a group of individuals, concerning the truth, have no value at all. Adherence to such views and doctrines, replacing the divine declarations, means choosing others as an authority besides Allah. \"The religion with Allah is Islam\" (see verse 19 of this surah) is the final divine announcement, after which there is no room for the controversies which have created many schools of thought, contradictory and hostile to each other, among the followers of the prophets. If all the followers of the prophets had kept intact the revealed books, and held fast to the true teachings of the messengers of Allah, instead of lending ear to the conjectural theorising of the rabbis and the priests, there would have not been so many dissenting divisions.\nSome followers of the Holy Prophet also ignored the teachings of the Quran and the declaration of the Holy Prophet regarding his Ahl ul Bayt and have gone astray, because they have turned to others, instead of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, for the truth, although the truth had been made clear by the Holy Prophet (see commentary of Ma-idah: 67). To rely on others and ignore the messenger of Allah is to obey a ghayrallah (other than Allah), which is shirk. Here it must be kept in mind that to pay respect, love, or adore those who, in obedience and submission to Allah, are acclaimed as models or ideals, is in itself obedience and submission to Allah. Remembrance or commemoration of such godly servants of Allah serves the purpose of service and devotion to Allah, as has been stated in verses 48 and 49 of al Sad. The surest way to worship and obey Allah is to follow the teachings and directions given by His prophets, messengers, and their appointed successors (please refer to verses 69 and 80 of al Nisa). But if they are held in esteem more or less than that which Allah has determined for them, or some other individuals are given the same status without any divine declaration, then it is like taking others to be gods apart from Allah (Tawbah: 3)\n"

From the beginning of the world to its end, Islam (total submission to the will of Allah) remains to be the only religion of Allah. Therefore to argue whether Ibrahim was a Jew or a Christian is a meaningless dispute between the two religions conjured out after centuries and centuries of Ibrahim's time. According to Baqarah: 128 and Hajj: 78. Ibrahim and his descendants were Muslims. Islam is the universal religion. All His prophets and their true followers were Muslims.\nBadshah Husain, in his English translation of the Quran, writes as under;\nThe Jewish belief is also difficult to define. Time was when it was grossly anthropomorphic and 'monolatros' (as Charles expressively calls it). The Yahweh was only the tribal God of Israel, the gods of other nations were not false, but it was the duty of Israelites to reject them. As culture extended, the other gods began to be denied and Yahweh remained the sole Lord and anthropomorphism also decreased and explanations were devised to interpret passages in the Pentateuch that spoke of God as walking in the gardens, fighting duels with men and the like. (Vol. II p. 53)\nThe Jews and the Christians dispute about the identity of the Holy Prophet whose advent has been clearly mentioned in the Tawrat and the Injil, of which they are fully aware. They do not know anything about the religion of Ibrahim, yet they, out of ignorance, say that he was a Jew or a Christian, whereas only Allah knows that he was a Muslim, neither a Jew nor a Christian. Whoso has submitted to the will of Allah, at any time and in any age, is a Muslim. To every people a prophet had been sent to preach Islam (submission to Allah) but each successive dispensation had been abused by its votaries, who in the course of time had turned aside from the true religion of Allah. It was the mission of the Holy Prophet to re-affirm, complete and perfect the religion of Allah in its minutest details, and make arrangements to let it prevail in all ages for all times to come, through the final book of Allah (the Quran), his Ahl ul Bayt and his way of life (sunnah).\n"

The discharge of a trust, as has also been underlined in Nisa: 58, Muminun: 8 and Ahzab: 72, is so emphasised in Islam that it is admired even in the enemies of the faith. Whatever faculties man possesses is an endowment entrusted to him by Allah, therefore, he must use them to fulfil His will and command. All contracts, pacts and treaties, made between men, whether political, economic or social, should be treated as a sacred trust and discharged according to the terms of the agreed covenant. Whoever keeps his pledge and fulfils his engagement to his fellow-creatures is exactly like he who keeps his covenant with Allah. Due to this quality the Holy Prophet was known as al amin, the trustworthy, even before he publicly made known his divine mission. His worst enemies used to deposit their valuables with him. At the time of leaving Makka, he handed over the deposits to Ali who returned them to the depositors on his behalf.\nAfter the fall of Makka, he entered the city and took the keys of the Ka-bah from its custodian, and after removing the idols, returned the keys to him, saying that all the customs and regulations of the pagan days had been cancelled by Islam save the fulfilment of trusts. According to the Holy Prophet, a man who prays, fasts and behaves like a believer, but lies when he talks, breaks his promises and cheats if trusted, is in fact a hypocrite.\n\"There is no reproach attaching to us in the matter of those who are not of our race and faith; we owe no duty to them\", sums up the attitude of the Jews towards other nations. As has been rightly observed by Hastings' \"Dictionary of the Bible\", the Jews were enemies of the human race, and the tendency of the Christians was no better. It is Islam, as explained above, which does not discriminate among people on account of religion, creed or faith but declares that telling the truth, fulfilling the promise and discharging the trust (whoever may be concerned) are the principal requisites of piety.

It is argued by some commentators that wherever mithaq is used in the Quran reference is made to the era prior to the existence of man in general and the prophets in particular. As there is no possibility of retaining any kind of conscious state prior to the physical birth of man, this assumption will be discussed when ruh (soul) and nafs (self) are dealt with.\nWhatever is the grammatical implication (whether the phrase lima or lama is relative or conditional) the meaning remains as under:\nAllah had made a covenant with each of His prophets, as an individual and as the leader of his respective followers (saying)-that which I have given you of the book and wisdom, (and) when a prophet will come to you confirming that which is with you, you shall surely believe in him and help him. All the prophets accepted the conditions of the covenant and promised and witnessed that their followers will carry out the terms of the covenant. This promise was fulfilled by every prophet concerning his succeeding prophet (and every succeeding prophet confirmed his predecessor), so all the prophets and their followers have to believe in the last prophet and help him. A true follower of Musa should fulfil the covenant Musa made with his Lord by believing in Isa; likewise a true follower of Isa should fulfil the covenant Isa made with his Lord by believing in Muhammad. If the Jews and the Christians do not believe in the last prophet of Allah, they render the covenant, Musa and Isa made with the Lord of worlds, null and void. They will be punished for breaking the covenant, not Musa and Isa, who fulfilled their promise in letter and spirit. Please refer to the commentary of al Ma-idah: 67 for the last covenant Allah took from the Muslims through the Holy Prophet about the wilayah (authority) of Ali ibna abi Talib at Ghadir Khum. It was the last divine guidance made available to man through the grace of the merciful Lord, so that an Imam after Imam, in the progeny of Ali, should guide mankind in every age till the day of resurrection.\nEvery human being perceives his coming into the conscious state from an insensitive condition through the agency of an active will, dominating him and his environment, which stimulates natural submission. In these verses (preceding and succeeding) the Quran introduces the universal religion (based upon reason and facts) prescribed for mankind which not only awakens positive response but also demolishes the myths fabricated by the Jews, the Christians and the pagans.\nThe old and the New Testaments, though not the original Tawrat and Injil (see \"The Tawrat\" and \"The Injil\" at the end of al Ma-idah), yet contain enough material to establish the fact that Musa and Isa fulfilled their covenant made with Allah. See Deuteronomy 18: 15, 18, 19; Acts 3: 22 to 24, 7: 37; John 1: 19 to 21; 14: 16, 17; 15: 26; 16: 7 to 14. (Text of these have been mentioned in the commentary of al Baqarah: 40). The advent of the Holy Prophet had been made known in clear words by Musa and Isa. In John 1: 19 to 21, it is stated that when Levites asked John the Baptist who he was, he confessed that he was not the Messiah nor Elijah. \"Are you the prophet we await?\" \"No\", he said. It shows that the people remembered the prophecies about the last prophet made by the previous prophets, and eagerly awaited his advent.\nIn John 14: 16, 17; 15: 26 and 16: 7 to 14, Isa refers to the Holy Prophet as comforter and spirit of truth, who will guide mankind into all truth. And \"who will be with you for ever\" implies that there shall always be a representative of him (his flesh and blood) on the earth, identical to him in purity (Ahzab: 33), who will carry out his mission.\nThe Holy Prophet has said:\nThe first of us is Muhammad,\nthe middle of us is Muhammad,\nthe last of us is Muhammad,\neveryone of us is Muhammad.\nIn every age, one of his sons (his descendant), in the progeny of Ali and Fatimah, will guide mankind as an Imam of the time till the day of resurrection. The Holy Prophet, Ali, Fatimah and the eleven holy Imams are of the one and the same divine light, manifesting the glory of the Lord of the worlds.\nA sincere seeker of truth, in his quest, comes to the conclusion that the divine source of guidance is Muhammad al Mustafa, the last prophet of Allah, and the Imams among his Ahl ul Bayt, whom the merciful Allah has particularly chosen to show the path of love, harmony and salvation to mankind.\n"

No event in the universe can take place without His creative will. Every living being, in order to please the absolute authority, consciously or subconsciously, follow His legislative will. \"Willingly or unwillingly\" refers to the conscious or subconscious submission to the will of Allah. The Holy Prophet developed this inherent and natural tendency to mindful awareness. Any religion other than Islam (complete submission to the absolute sovereignty of Allah) shall not be accepted by Him.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:89]\nSincere repentance followed by efficient improvement is the key to open the doors of forgiveness beyond which a new life, full of promised blessings, awaits the deviators.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nTawba means \"return penitently to God\" with reference to the creature, and \"admit the penitent to God's mercy\" with reference to the creator Lord; just as salat (with reference to the creature) means bending before the creator Lord to express wants and needs for obtaining fulfilment, and (with reference to the creator Lord) turning towards the supplicant creature to give that which he deserves.\nHe who does not carry out Allah's command, disobeys Him. It is a sin which earns punishment. Although there are various degrees of disobedience, minor sins lead to major sins. Infidelity (denial of Allah's absolute sovereignty) is the worst sin. Punishment of each sin differs according to its degree. \"Verily Allah forgives all sins\" (Zumar: 53). Of whatever degree the sin is, if the sinner turns repentantly to Allah, sincerely seeking to amend his ways in future, Allah will admit him to His mercy. Tawba is a cleansing procedure to remove ignorance and obstinacy from the heart and the mind and to wipe out the dirt of theoretical and practical \"deviation from the right path\".\nAllah may admit the sinner to His mercy at any time before the punishment comes upon him when no one will come for his help (Zumar: 54); or He may admit the sinner to His mercy if he does evil in ignorance (and) then turn quickly (in repentance) to Allah (Nisa: 17). But repentance is not (profitable) for those who do ill deeds until, when death comes to one of them (Nisa: 18), and shall not benefit them their faith when they see His punishment (Mu-min: 85). The doors of repentance are open till the agony of death overcomes the body.\nIn Yunus: 98, the removal of punishment at the last moment shows that sincere repentance is effective, but Mu-min: 85 makes it clear that repentance to avoid punishment brings no result. Imam Ali bin Muhammad al Naqi had quoted this verse to give his decision when Mutawakkil referred the case of a Jew who committed adultery with a Muslim woman and recited kalimah as soon as he was brought in the court of the ruler. The jurists of the court had wrongly advised him to acquit the Jew on the basis of a tradition which states that when a man becomes a Muslim his past is separated from him. But as, in this case, the Jew accepted Islam to avoid punishment, therefore the holy Imam judged him guilty.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:92]\nPlease refer to al Baqarah: 3, 195, 215, 254. \"That which you love\" means all that you hold dear and near to your heart. The term covers the spending of one's wealth and possessions and the sacrificing of one's personal significance and pride as well as the shedding of one's blood in the service of Allah. At a time when the religion of Allah and the overall welfare of the human society are in danger of mutilation, a true Muslim (one who has surrendered himself to Allah) acts without any regard to his own interests (selflessness), a hallmark of the truly righteous. The best, the greatest and the most perfect example of \"spending that which you love\" in the service of Allah was set in Karbala, where Imam Husayn sacrificed his social status, wealth, children, and life in the service of Allah to establish the supremacy of the highest human values without which no human society can survive and progress. In fact it was the Holy Prophet who manifested himself through his grandson, Imam Husayn, to prove his declaration that: \"Husayn is from me and I am from Husayn\".\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nSome passages of the Bible give the impression that the doors of the heavenly kingdom are closed for the rich. It is not true. If a man, be he poor or rich, willingly submits to Allah and spends \"that which he loves\" in the service of Allah, he becomes entitled to the everlasting bliss of the life of the hereafter.\nThe Holy Prophet has said:\nThe wealthy who does not wait to spend in the way of Allah until a needy comes to his door but goes to the abode of the poor to mitigate his suffering is the true God-fearing pious.\nThere is no restriction or fixation so as to what and how much should be spent in the way of Allah. That which is to be given has to be determined according to the degree of attachment with the commodity. A rich man may not care for the money, he has in abundance, but will not part with some of his belongings he holds near and dear to him, in which case no amount of money, spent in lieu of the things he loves most, can earn for him the righteousness or virtue referred to in this verse. For how much is to be given (the limit), the example has been set in Karbala by Imam Husayn. It should be noted that zakat and khums, the minimum prescribed amounts to be given by every Muslim, have not been referred to here. The spending of \"that which you love\" is optional. The demand made in this verse can be taken up and fulfilled by only a true believer in Allah who alone can selflessly put aside his own interests to give preference to the overall welfare of his fellow beings, which alone brings harmony and social justice in the human society.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:93]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Jews in the Holy Prophet's time were accusing the Muslims of taking certain foods which, they said, had been unlawful since the days of Ibrahim. The Quran denies the charge, and puts the Jews to silence by a reference to their own scripture, the Tawrat. The original law of Musa contained the same prohibitions and permissions, concerning eatables, prescribed by Islam, but the Jews had corrupted the book revealed to Musa and replaced it with fanciful customs, acquired paganish points of view and introduced them in their faith over the years.\nBahimatul an-am (four-footed animals such as goats, sheep, oxen and camels and those like them who eat grass and vegetation) are allowed (Ma-idah: 1) except a few of them (the clawed flesh-eating animals like tigers, lions, cats, dogs- known as Siba'), eating of which is not allowed. See books of fiqh. According to An-am: 142 to 146 certain parts of the lawful animals were prohibited as a punishment because of the perverse and rebellious attitude of the Jews, otherwise none of the animals which eat grass or vegetation were forbidden even in the law of Musa, but due to the introduction of folklore in their religion, the Jews wrongly presumed that camel and its milk were the forbidden items since the days of Ibrahim. This verse exposes their ignorance.\nIslam (submission to Allah's will and command) was the religion of Ibrahim. The Tawrat and the Injil also contained the fundamentals of the true religion of Allah which purify the mind and the body in a practical and harmonious way. The harshness of Judaism and leniency of Christianity are far from the universal truth with reference to actuality.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:96]\nSee commentary of al Ahzab: 33 for the first house (awwala baytin). Also refer to Baqrah: 125, 127 and al Hajj: 29, 33.\nBakka is a variant for Makka, either derived from tabakk i.e. press one another in a crowd, or bakk i.e. break one's neck, because whenever it was attacked by an invader his neck had been broken-defeated and crushed. Another version is that Bakka means the holy house of Kabah, a guidance unto the worlds.\nMubarakan means rich in blessings; abounding in good.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe great antiquity of this house is undisputed. It had been throughout the ages, even before Ibrahim, the object of the greatest veneration\nIt is reported on the authority of the Ahl ul Bayt that the valley of Makka was the first part of the earth which emerged above the surface of the water and cooled down when the heavens and the earth (an integrated mass) were split by Allah's command (Anbiya: 30, 31), in support of which there are a number of geological evidences. Many a non-Muslim scholar agrees that this holy place, dedicated to the worship of the Lord of the lords, was not only known to the people of Semitic origin but also to the ancient inhabitants of India according to the references available in pre-Sanskrit literature. Ibrahim's prayer in Ibrahim : 37 confirms its antiquity. In Baqarah: 125 and 129, it is implied that Allah commanded Ibrahim to renew its foundations, purify it and establish it as a place of worship of the almighty Lord, and settle down there along with his family. The family of Ismail was chosen as the first human family to inhabit this land with the sole purpose of dedicating themselves wholly to the worship and the service of the Lord of the worlds. The family of Ismail was the first to be called \"the people of the house\" (Ahl ul Bayt), then Is-haq and his mother (Hud: 73) and after that Musa and his mother (Qasas: 12) were referred to as Ahl ul Bayt. The term Ahl ul Bayt has been used for the descendants of Ibrahim (the lineage of Ibrahim through Is-haq was cut off after Isa). Actually al-bayt (the house) refers to the house of Allah, and the descendants of Isma-il have been referred to as Ahl ul Bayt because they had devoted themselves, without any deviation, gap or drift, to the service of Allah and His house. They were the founders and the protectors of the house of Allah, and it is to their lineage references have been made in verses 36 and 37 of al Nur.\nThe place they founded and established for the remembrance of Allah has been described as a blessed, sacred sanctuary, and a guidance unto the worlds, because they devoted their lives to its service and attracted mankind to its ultimate purpose through their ideal virtues and righteousness. The house and the people of the house are inseparable. Their house, wherever it may be, is the house of Allah. As they cannot be separated from the Quran (hadith al thaqalayn) the house of Allah can never be without their presence. The house is a guidance if the people of the house are identified and kept in view. The house is a sanctuary and a blessing if one enters it by the permission and pleasure of the Ahl ul Bayt, described as safinatul Nuh.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:97]\nThe station or the standing place of Ibrahim, the model believer in the unity of Allah, has the following points of significance (clear signs).\n(1) The standing place of Ibrahim has been made the permanent religious centre of all monotheists, because his faith (belief in the unity of Allah) was perfect, an ideal for every believer.\n(2) It is a sacred sanctuary. Whoso enters it is safe from the clutches of the disbelievers. It is a historic fact that all invaders who attacked this holy precinct were destroyed.\n(The grandson of the Holy Prophet, Imam Husayn, was deprived of the security in Kabah in 60 Hijra by the order of Yazid bin Mu-awiyah).\n(3) Pilgrimage to the Kabah to seek spiritual guidance has been made obligatory on mankind for ever. The believers shall go to Kabah to carry out the command of Allah till the day of resurrection. It should be noted that this prophecy was made at a time when the Muslims were in danger of being exterminated by their enemies.\nSee the commentary of al Baqarah: 196.\nThis institution of pilgrimage (hajj) has taken root in the lives of the Muslims. Every year a great many pilgrims come to Kabah to translate their faith into action. There is no sponsor, no convenor, no invitation, no compulsion. At Kabah, during the pilgrimage, they forget their social status, ideology, race, colour, and nationality and become a single party of the servants of Allah, dressed in a simple identical garment, standing in rows, shoulder to shoulder, before their Lord, in front of His holy house, praying to one God, in the language of the Quran, which, truly, is the everlasting miracle of the prophet of Islam, a clear sign of the victory of truth.\nIn the end it is made clear that one who has sufficient means must perform the hajj. Wilful neglect of this commandment of Allah amounts to the abandonment of His faith (infidelity). So he who wilfully neglects the pilgrimage does so at his own peril, and not to any hurt to his Lord, because He is independent of the worlds. He is self-sufficient. Whether the whole mankind serve Him or none observe His commandments, it makes no difference to Him whatsoever. The hajj has been prescribed for man's own good. There is no profit or gain for Him. It is an escape from the sins a man commits (and its consequences) to take refuge under the shelter of Allah's mercy.\nThe Holy Prophet has said:\nHe who wilfully does not perform the hajj shall rise on the day of resurrection in the state of infidelity, having no vision.\nHajj wipes out the sins as fire removes corrosion from the iron.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n(1) \"Who can afford\" means ability with ease concerning wealth, health and security. In the case of any adverse condition this ordinance is not applicable.\n(2) Man kafara (whosoever denies) shows the importance of the pilgrimage. As the Holy Prophet has said \"the able but wilful non-performer\" becomes an infidel. It is a positive test of the submission to Allah's will and a sure remedy to cure the evil disease of egotism.\n"

If not His love, then the consciousness of His omniscience should prompt man to believe in the truth of His signs.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nWhenever the Quran addresses the people of the book to reproach them for their mischievous deviation from the right path, shown by all the scriptures, it should not be confined to those Jews and Christians who opposed Islam and the Holy Prophet in his time, but as Imam Jafar al Sadiq has pointed out, it includes all the people of the book in post-Islamic era and also all those who claim their religions to be divinely revealed, in all ages, till the day of resurrection.

If my people hold fast to these two ropes, after me, they shall not go astray. They are the book of Allah, hung from the heaven unto the earth, and my Ahl ul Bayt. One of them is greater than the other.

He who sails on it will be safe, but he who holds back shall perish.\nThere are several traditions of the Holy Prophet, mentioned on page 5 and 6, which confirm, beyond doubt, that Muhammad and ali Muhammad were the natiq Quran and the revealed book of Allah is the samit Quran (see commentary of al Baqarah: 2).\nThe Holy Prophet has said:\nVerily the Quran has been revealed in seven letters.

So to remain on the right path shown by the Holy Prophet follow him and his Ahl ul Bayt in letter and spirit.\nIn Minhaj al Sadiqin it is written that once, Jalut, the chief rabbi, along with some of his very learned disciples, came to Ali ibna abi Talib to prove that Islam was not a true religion of God.\nThe first question Ali asked was:\n\"Do you know the number of sects the followers of Musa were divided into after his departure?\"\n\"I will have to refer to the book\", he replied.\n\"You are a rabbi, yet do not know what is written in your book. What will you do if your book is lost?\" Ali asked.\nJalut referred to his book and said that there were 45 sects.\n\"You are wrong. I know the Tawrat and the Injil. The followers of Musa were divided into 71 sects, out of which only one is on the right path. Also the followers of Isa were divided into 71 sects, out of which only one is on the right path. The followers of our prophet will be divided into 73 sects, out of which only one will be on the right path and the rest will be among the losers.\"\nEarlier the Holy Prophet had also said the same about his and Musa's followers. When asked as-to which sect of his followers is on the right path, he put his hand on the shoulder of Ali and said:\n\"This man and his descendants and their followers.\" Then he recited this verse:\n\"You became brothers by His grace\"-Deadly warfare in pre-islamic Arabia has been proverbial, and pagan Arabia, divided into hostile clans and tribes, presented the sight of a veritable armed camp. In the time of ignorance, hostility was embittered with the rancour of civil faction. The recital of an obsolete feud, in prose or verse, was sufficient to rekindle the same passion among the descendants of the hostile tribes. In private life, every man, at best every family, was the judge and avenger of its own cause. A petty affront or unpremeditated blow involved whole tribes and tracts of country in protracted and bloody strife. It was the Holy Prophet who introduced and implanted into the anarchical society of his time sentiments of brotherhood, sense of meaningful life and consciousness of rights and duties towards one another. In this way the Holy Prophet united together classes and tribes that hitherto had been continually at feud with one another. Within a brief span of time, he called forth out of uncompromising material a nation never united before, bound in common faith, suppressing every distinction of race and kindred, and regarding each other as brothers, by active efforts and the immaculate pattern of his personal way of life, which mere preaching could never accomplish. It was the genius of the Holy Prophet which not only united wild enemies to create a universal brotherhood composed of all men of every race, who would obey and worship one God and follow the teachings and guidance of His prophet, but also made them vie with each other in generous emulation of courage and fidelity.\n\"Haply or so that\" indicate that the creation of brotherhood was not an end in itself, but it was a pre-requisite to follow the true guidance kept alive through the holy Ahl ul Bayt, in every age, till the day of resurrection.\nOnly the mischievous mind of the Ahmadi scholar can translate habl as covenant and nar as strife, otherwise not even a far-fetched implication gives any room for such misinterpretation.\n"

They killed all the holy Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt, from Imam Ali bin Husayn to Imam Hasan bin Ali, and some of them desecrated the holy Kabah and the holy masjid nabawwi.\nThe torturers, persecutors and murderers, mentioned above, are not only considered Muslims but respected as the khalifatul muslimin or khalifatur rasul by the majority of the Muslims except the followers of Muhammad and ali Muhammad (Shi-as) who acknowledge the Ahl ul Bayt only as the best group of people because of their learning, knowledge and wisdom and because of their highmindedness, generosity, bravery, justice and refinement of character-a true reflection of the way of life of the Holy Prophet.\nThe abominable features of the \"heroes of the Muslims\", described in \"Stanley's lectures on Eastern Church\" and \"Albiruni's India\", have been driving away the seekers of truth, among nonmuslims, from the religion of Islam. But when some of them happen to come across the life accounts of the khayra ummatin (the best group of people), the Ahl ul Bayt, they willingly come into the fold of Islam. Even the worst enemies of Islam have greatly praised the irresistible glory of the godly members of the family of the Holy Prophet. In the light of the Quranic verses and traditions of the Holy Prophet, mentioned in the commentary of various relevant verses in this book, the Ahl ul Bayt are the \"best group of people\" thoroughly purified by Allah Himself (Ahzab: 33), inseparably attached with the Quran, flesh and blood of the Holy Prophet, who are from him and he is from them (reflecting one and the same light of Allah). Therefore, to harass them is to harass Allah and the Prophet of Allah, for which Allah curses such people in this world and the hereafter (Ahzab: 57); and to make less their status or to bring others to their position earns the wrath of Allah (Fatihah: 7).\n"

In the commentaries written by the Muslim scholars no reference is made to Ali ibn abi Talib, in spite of the historic truth that each time the Muslims were on the brink of total annihilation, Ali came forward, in all the battles fought against the Jews and the pagans of Makka, and changed sure defeats into victories. Ali was the hand of Allah, His aid and support, His promise and His blessing. Most probably his name is not mentioned because, in that event, they also have to take the names of those companions who either watched the battle from a safe distance or, when the going was rough, ran away from the scene of fighting to save their lives, but surprisingly took control of the destiny of the Muslims as soon as the Holy Prophet left this world, although he emphatically told the ummah that he was leaving behind, for their guidance, the book of Allah and his Ahl ul Bayt (hadith thaqalayn- see page 6), and irrevocably established the authority of Ali at Ghadir Khum (see commentary of al Ma-idah: 67).\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:113]\nPlease refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 62. Those Jews and Christians, who believe in the original books sent to their prophets and follow their true teachings, have to believe in the Quran and the prophethood of the last prophet of Allah, therefore, in all fairness, the Quran recognises the goodness and righteousness found in the true followers of Musa and Isa for rewarding them with proper recompense.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nVerses 101 to 115 contain the fundamental directions essential for a peaceful, just and pious human society. In addition to man-God relationship, the religion of Allah, Islam, also lays down the principles which direct, develop and sustain interrelations between the human beings as well as their true position in the universe. Islam not only establishes peace, unity and harmony between man and man but also effects co-ordination between mankind, as a part, and the universe, as a whole, viewed in a perspective beyond the limitation of time and space. Many attempts had been made, and the quest continues, to unite mankind to usher in an era of peace and harmony, but each venture has created new divisions. Unless man agrees not to exercise his will and choice in preference to the common good of the society universal brotherhood cannot be established. He must sacrifice his will and choice by curtailing his independence in the interest of the common good, which means submission of his will. The social, economic and political sciences deal with the question as to in whose interest (family, community, race or country) man should sacrifice his independence, and to whose authority he should submit!? Islam puts the universal interest above the individual interest, and makes it clear that there is no authority save the authority of the almighty Allah to which every individual must submit. Keeping this in view the Quran refers to the establishment of an institution which not only would call people to Allah (the absolute goodness) but also exercise authority over mankind to guide them to that which is approved by the human conscience as well as by the divine sanction; and would prevent them from doing that which is unprofitable and harmful, an evil rejected by the human conscience as well as forbidden by the divine decree Verse 104 says that the authority to enjoin the right (amr bil ma-ruf) and forbid the wrong (nahya anil munkar) entails conditions in which all the members of the society cannot share. They can assist the divinely established authority in the duty of enjoining good and forbidding evil, because only those who know the ultimate and the absolute good have been found competent and qualified to be chosen for this assignment. The most essential prerequisite to shoulder this responsibility is to be in a state of perfect awareness for doing good and avoiding evil so that there is no need to be guided by any one to do ma-ruf and abstain from munkar.\nIn verse 104 ummat means a-imma, because ummat is derived from amm (meaning) to intend, to lead, to give an example to others, or to command. In the sense of tending or intending it becomes the \"way\" intended to or to move on (tariq), or imam, the person intended to be followed, or mamun, the person who intends to follow-to follow certain persons or principles. The word ummat has been used in all these senses in the verses of the Quran. In verses 104 and 113 of Ali Imran and verses 128 and 143 of al Baqarah the context shows that ummat stands for an imam, who exercises authority, not for mamun.\nVerses 101 to 103 make it clear that once a man becomes a Muslim (submits to the absolute sovereignty of Allah) he shall not follow any other path except the guidance revealed through the Quran and made known by the Holy Prophet, which, in fact, is the substance of the surah Ali Imran. Even a slightest deviation from this path, by relying on personal discretion in order to make amendment in the guidance provided by Allah and His Prophet, has been declared as going back to the days of ignorance (partisanship and sectarianism) or falling into the abyss of eternal damnation.\nHe who holds fast to the rope of Allah (adheres to His book, His prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt) is described as orthodox (sound and upright in belief and doctrine, not dogmatic or irrational), and he who relies on his own judgement or on the conjectural or arbitrary discretion of those who have not been endowed by the divine wisdom, nor ever declared by the Holy Prophet as the inheritors of his wisdom, is described as heterodox. In verse 153 of al An-am Allah says that only His path is right, follow it, and do not follow other ways, because that will deviate you from His path and lead to heresy and heterodoxy. Some early commentators wrongly presumed that verse 16 of al Taghabun abrogates the contents of verse 103 of Ali Imran. A proper study of these verses shows that one supports the other. Please refer to the commentary of Taghabun: 16. It is said that the occasion for the revelation of verse 103 was a dispute, took place between the two groups of ansars, on the instigation of a Jew. Whatever be the cause \"the enjoining good and forbidding evil\" by a select group, as said in verse 104 is the basis of the social structure of the human society.\nThe establishment of an institution to save mankind from dissension and discord, which would lead to total perdition, has been justified in verses 104 to 108. The purpose in view is to promote universal justice and harmony and safeguard the interests of all creation, on the earth, in the heavens and in between them. To control and operate this institution suitable persons are chosen by Allah Himself on merit. Human choice or discretion has no place.\nAnd your Lord creates what He wills, and (also) chooses. They (the created beings) have never any choice.\n(Qasas: 68)\nThe inseparable second person masculine gender pronoun in verse 104, refers to a particular group of men, purposefully brought forth from the fold of His providence, to guide mankind. Please refer to the commentary of verses 104 and 110 for identifying those who have the competency, efficiency and authority to enjoin good and forbid evil.\nOnce Imam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq asked a scholar whether he thought the pronoun tum in kuntum (in verse 110 of Ali Imran) referred to the Muslims in general? \"Yes\" was his reply.\n\"It means you, who killed the grandson of the Holy Prophet and tortured his family in captivity, are the best people brought forth by Allah to guide and benefit the mankind\". the Imam said.\n\"No. It cannot be!\" The scholar exclaimed. \"Behold! It refers only to those who are competent to lead mankind to truth\", the Imam advised him.\nTherefore if it is inferred that waltakun min kum gives permission to the Muslims to elect, appoint or nominate a person or a group of persons to guide or lead people, the implication would be a far-fetched heretical innovation, because the verse only points out to the necessity of such an institution, just as the necessity of the prophets of Allah to convey His message of guidance to the people, but does not give permission to the people (in either case) to elect, nominate or appoint the prophets or those who enjoin good and forbid evil. Verse 110 asserts that such a group (from the descendants of Ibrahim) has been brought forth for the guidance of mankind. Al Baqarah: 124, 128, 143 and al Hajj: 77 and 78 refer to those descendants of Ibrahim who have been chosen to inherit the book, the wisdom and the great kingdom, and whose obedience has been enjoined on mankind. Only these are they who are authorised to exercise amr bil ma-ruf and nahya anil munkar. Those who follow them in letter and spirit and are thoroughly well-versed in their knowledge and wisdom can work as their subordinates. Verse 113 and 114 contain the qualities the above noted select group of man possess to the point of highest perfection. Verse 165 of al-An-am says that it is Allah who has made the believers successors in the earth but has raised some of them over others in degrees, therefore all the believers are not equal. Those who are lower in degree should function as the subordinates of those who occupy the higher grade, otherwise there will be no harmony and order in the system. Having failed to understand the true meanings of these verses many Muslim scholars have suggested a chaotic and inconsistent form of Islamic government because of which the Muslim society has been, so far, administered by despots, tyrants and usurpers.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 3:121]\nTwelve months after the battle of Badr, when the third year of the Holy Prophet's stay at Madina was drawing to a close, there burst out a storm of unprecedented violence. Abu Sufyan, a zealous votary of the idols, a mortal foe of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, the chief of the pagan Makkan tribes and head of the brand of Umayyah, had mobilised an army of 3000 warriors to avenge the defeat at Badr. He secretly negotiated an alliance with the Jews of Madina who agreed to attack the small band of Muslims when the major offensive would begin. After exceedingly elaborate preparations, the Quraysh commenced their march, 3000 strong; 700 were mailed warriors, and 200 well-mounted cavalry; the remainder rode on camels. Women were allowed to accompany them. Taking timbrels in their hands, they sang to their wild cadence songs of vengeance for kinsmen slain at Badr.\nThe Muslims, able to fight, all told, were one thousand. To confront the enemy in an open field, the Holy Prophet reached Uhad. At the last moment on the pretext that his advice to wait and offer defence in Madina was not accepted Abdullah bin Ubay along with his 300 followers suddenly turned round and, deserting the Muslims, took the road back to Madina. Thus the Holy Prophet was left with 700 followers, facing a well-equipped army four times their number.\nThere was a pass in the hills of Uhad through which the enemy soldiers could come and attack, so, the Holy Prophet stationed 50 archers under the command of Abdullah bin Jubayr at the mouth of the pass with strict instructions not to leave the post at any event.\nAll the authentic books of history record that as soon as the fight began Ali and Hamza slashed the rows after rows of the enemy soldiers and sooner than expected the enemy took to their heels. Fascinated by the abrupt flight of the Makkan pagans, the unscrupulous companions of the Holy Prophet went in for loot and plunder. The archers also yielded to temptation and left their post by disobeying the orders of their commander. Khalid bin Walid, who was yet an unbeliever, with his men, attacked the unwary Muslims busy in collecting the booty from this opening and caught them off their guard. There was confusion and disorder. The pagans availed the opportunity and surrounded the Holy Prophet. He was wounded and fell into a pit. At this time some one or Shaytan raised the cry \"Muhammad has been killed.\" On hearing this cry even some of the closest companions of the Holy Prophet (who later became the leaders of the Muslims ) also took to flight. The whereabouts of some of them became known after three days. One deserter suggested to send a messenger to Abdullah bin Obay so that he might obtain amnesty from Abu Sufyan. Tabari, Ibn Hisham and Tarikh al Khamis report that the second caliph was also among the deserters. Shibli says desperate despondency had seized the companions. All deserted the messenger of Allah except Ali, Abu Dajjana and Sahl ibn Hunayf. The hand of Allah (yadullah), Ali, unsheathed his sword; the fearless, unconquerable and ever-overpowering strength of Allah (asdadullah), Ali, demonstrated his singular prowess as the executor of wonders {mazhar al aja-ib). Ali put so memorable a fight that Jibrail gloried Ali's action with the celebrated sentence: \"la fata illa Ali\" (there is no man save Ali) and \"la sayf illa dhulfiqar\" (there is no sword save dhulfiqar). The scene again changed and the three thousand proud warriors of Arabia ran from the battlefield like frightened rats, with Abu Sufyan in the front, and stopped at Hamra ul Asad, 8 miles away from Uhad. There he reviewed his misadventure to know the reason which changed certain victory into humiliating defeat. He was planning to launch another attack, but, before he could regroup the disheartened soldiers, the news of a possible pursuit by Ali ibn abi Talib broke his spirit and he at once took the road to Makka.\nHamza, a valiant warrior, the uncle of the Holy Prophet, was martyred in this battle. Hinda, the wife of Abu Sufyan, the mother of Mu-awiyah, had hired an Abyssinian slave to kill the Holy Prophet, Hamza and Ali. He took out the liver of Hamza and gave it to Hinda. She chewed it and tried to eat it but could not. Then she washed the pieces, made a garland and wore it around her neck.\nIn view of verses 2 to 4 of al Ankabut it can be stated that the battle of Uhad was a trial and a test for those who professed to believe in Allah and His messenger.\n"

Hamza and Ali were the heros of the battle of Badr, which was of the greatest importance for the spread of Islam. On the hands of Hamza and Ali, under the command of the Holy Prophet, Islam had won its first and decisive military victory.\nAllah had reinforced the Muslims with three thousand angels, a heavenly aid given to the Holy Prophet, not actually to fight the enemy but to increase the very small group of men he had with him so that the Muslims could muster courage; and the enemy might be frightened at the sight of a large assemblage. It was Allah alone, not the angels, who really caused victory through the valour of Ali and Hamza which brought the enemy to their knees.\nThe Muslim were poor in numbers, mounts and armour. The spirit of discipline and contempt of death manifested by the heroes of Badr (mentioned above), evident in all the battles the Holy Prophet fought, was due to their total reliance on Allah with whom they always took refuge and unto whom they always turned thankful.\nVerse 127 infers the facts that seventy of the chosen chiefs of the Quraysh were slain and seventy others were taken captive, a complete rout, through Ali (yadullah-hand of Allah) after which, broken, in utter despair they went back to their homes.\n"

Phineas bin Azura, a leading Jew, thought it fit to make fun of the expression, and mockingly remarked: \"Surely God is poor, since they seek to borrow for Him\".

They mocked at the messengers of Allah, killed them, despised Allah's words and belied His prophets. They shall, surely, taste the torment of the burning.\nAnd the Jews say: \"Allah's hand is tied-up\". Tied be their own hands, and damned be they for saying what they say! Nay, both His hands are open wide: He expends as He pleases. That which has been revealed to you from your Lord will certainly increase many of them in rebellion and infidelity.

Fire came out from before the Lord and consumed the whole-offering.\" (Leviticus 9: 23 and 24).\nAlso refer to John 13: 20 to 23; the First book of King 18: 38; The first book of the Chronicles 21: 26; The second book of the Chronicles 7: 1.\nFire was regarded by the Jews \"as one of the agents of divine will\", and divine fire was expected to consume the acceptable offering. In the ancient Jewish religion and many others fire is the means whereby offerings are transmitted to the deity. And it was also perhaps this deep-rooted superstition that led the Jews of later times to offer their children as sacrifice to Molch, the god of fire.\nSo, the Jews said to the Holy Prophet that God had charged them to believe in no prophet until he works this miracle. Firstly Allah's power may not always manifest through one and the same miracle, because the intellect and the temperament of the people have been undergoing a constant change in upward direction. The appearance of fire to consume sacrifices offered was only suitable to the intellect of the Jews of the ancient times. In Islam, the final, perfected and completed religion of Allah, God is beneficent and merciful, and so in all accounts where a manifestation of Allah is spoken of allegorically, He is represented as light (nur), never as fire. It is stated in verse 35 of al Nur that the glow is without fire-no fire has touched it (light upon light). It is not the meat or blood of the sacrificed animals that reaches Allah. It is the fealty of your heart that reaches Him (Hajj: 37). Secondly, if it was the working of this particular miracle that could generate belief in the Jews, and their hesitating and refusing to believe in the Holy Prophet was on account of it, why then did they refuse to believe in those prophets who had wrought it (among other miracles), and even impetuously murdered them!\n"

Thus monogamy is the ideal; and polygamy is only allowed as a safeguard against greater social evils.\nThe so-called civilised ideologies have maligned the \"permission to marry four women\", in complete disregard to all natural facts, overlooking the miserable conditions prevalent, in the world, before Islam. Islam, in fact, has provided a rational positive direction to the sexual anarchy and topsy-turvy man-woman relationship the human society had been living through till the advent of the Holy Prophet in Arabia, and continues to so live in societies where formal permission to marry more than one women does not exist.\nWhatever Allah enjoins on mankind is in their own interest. It is the nature of man to raise questions, but those who sincerely make efforts, after trial and error, come to the conclusion that the divine injunctions alone can solve their problems.\nThe opinion of some of the anthropologists and sociologists of repute are given below:\n\"In general a gregarious life, a life in association, favours polygamy. The most civilised nations must have begun with polygamy, and, in reality, it has been thus everywhere and always. In the various civilised societies, living or dead, marriage has commenced by being polygamous. It is a law which has few exceptions.\"\n(Evolution of marriage-M. Letourneau)\n\"Monogamy far from being defended on the scope of its \"naturalness\" no anthropologist of note has even maintained that monogamic marriage was natural to male human being. The evidence is all the other way, and we learn on the best authorities that \"as an institution polygamy exists in all parts of the world, and that it has flourished among the Hebrews, the Slavs, the Teutons, the Irish and the Indians, none of the Hindu law-givers ever restricting the number of wives a man is allowed to marry.\" Polygamy was the rule in Biblical days, among the ancient Jews, and was permitted and even enjoined in certain cases by the Mosaic law. It is nowhere forbidden, except to \"bishops\" in the New Testament.\"\n(Encyclopaedia Britannica)\n\"The practice of polygamy among the Vedic Indians is abundantly proved by direct references in the Rig Veda and other texts. The heroes and Brahmans of the epic are frequently represented as having several wives.\"\n(Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religions and Ethics).\n\"Woman is, by nature, a monogamist; man has in him the element of a polygamist.\"\n(Conduct and its disorders biologically considered-Dr. Mercier)\n\"Lifelong monogamy is perverse, and would prove harmful to our race. Were this institution ever really enforced-and fortunately this is almost never the case in reality-the race must decay.\" (Professor Earnest Bergman) \"The fact that polygamy has been practised is in itself a proof that the sexes do not exist in the uniform proportion. It is mischievously and foolishly thought, and implied in our social practice that the sexual needs of men and women are identical. Nothing is farther from the truth. A woman's urgent need of man has, as its ultimate instinctive motive the bearing of the children; when that is achieved the desire for a man becomes quite a secondary matter. On the other hand, a man needs women for himself. Both desires are complementary and fulfil each other; they are not identical.\"\n(Macfarlane, the case for polygamy)\nIf he takes another woman, he shall not deprive the first of meat, clothes, and conjugal rights.\n(Exodus 21: 10)\nI gave you (David) your master's daughter and his wives to be your own,\n(2 Samuel 12: 8)\n\"And so it was understood by the leaders of Christendom at various times that there is no intrinsic immorality or sinfulness in plurality of wives. One of the greatest fathers of the Christian Church (St. Augustine) has declared that polygamy is not a crime where it is a legal institution of a country, and the German reformers, even as late as the sixteenth century, allowed and declared valid the taking of a second or even a third wife, contemporaneously with the first, in default of issue, or any other cause.\"\n(Ameer Ali-Life and Teachings of Muhammad.)\n\"In the definition which l have given (i.e. of marriage) I have not said, in compliance with the common opinion, 'of one man with one woman', lest I should by implication charge the holy patriarchs and pillars of our faith, Abraham, and the others who had more than one wife at the same time, with habitual fornication and adultery, lest I should be forced to exclude from the sanctuary of God as spurious the holy offspring which sprang from them, yes, the whole of the sons of Israel, for whom the sanctuary itself was made. For it is said (Deut. 22: 2): \"A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of Jehovah, even to his tenth generation\". Either, therefore, polygamy is a true marriage or all children born in that state are spurious: which would include the whole race of Jacob, the twelve holy tribes chosen by God. But as such an assertion would be absurd in the extreme, not to say impious, and as it is the height of injustice, as well as an example of most dangerous tendency in religion, 'to account as sin what is not such in reality', it appears true that, so far from the question respecting the lawfulness of polygamy being trivial, it is of the highest importance that it should be decided.\"\n(John Milton-A treatise on Christian Doctrine)\n\"Before Islam, a woman was not free to contract her marriage. It was the right of the father, brother, cousin, or any other male guardian, to give her in marriage, whether she was old or young, widow or virgin, to whomsoever he chose. Her consent was of no significance. There was even a practice prevalent of marrying women by force. This often happened on the death of a man leaving widows. His son or other heir would immediately cast a sheet of cloth on each of the widows (excepting his natural mother), and this was a symbol that he had annexed them to himself. If a widow escaped to her relations before the sheet was thrown over her, the heirs of the deceased would refuse to pay the dower. This custom is described as the inheriting of a deceased man's widows by his heirs, who in such cases would divide them among themselves like goods. There was no restriction as to the number of wives a man could take. The only limit was that imposed by his means, opportunity and inclinations. Unrestricted polygamy which was sanctioned by usage was freely rampant. This was exclusive of the number of slave girls which a man might possess.\nThe limits of relationship within which marriage was prohibited were narrow and defined only by close degrees of consanguinity. There can be no doubt that a man could not marry his mother, grandmother, sister, daughter or grand-daughter, and perhaps he was not allowed to marry his aunt or niece. But those among them \"that followed the Magian religion could marry their own daughters and sisters.\" An Arab was permitted to take as his wife his step-mother, cousin, wife's sisters, and could combine in marriage two sisters or a woman and her niece. It is doubtful whether he could marry his mother-in-law or step-daughter. Unrestrained as an Arab was in the number of his wives, he was likewise absolutely free to release himself from the marital tie. His power in this connection was absolute and he was not required or expected to assign any reason for its exercise, nor was he under the necessity of observing any particular procedure. The word commonly used for this purpose was 'Talaq'. It depended upon his discretion whether he would dissolve the marriage absolutely and thus set the woman free to marry or not. He might, if he so chose, revoke the divorce and resume marital connection. Sometimes an Arab would pronounce 'Talaq' ten times and take his wife back, and again divorce her and again take her back, and so on. The wife in such a predicament was entirely at the mercy of the husband, and would not know when she was free. Sometimes the husband would renounce his wife by means of what was called a suspensory divorce. This procedure did not dissolve the marriage, but it only enabled the husband to refuse to live with his wife, while the latter was not at liberty to marry again. The wife among the Arabs had no corresponding right to release herself from the marriage bond. But her parents by a friendly arrangement with the husband could obtain a separation by returning the dower if it had been paid, or by agreeing to forego it if not paid. Such an arrangement was called 'Khula', and by it the marriage tie would be absolutely dissolved.\"\n(Abdur Rahim-Muhammadan Jurisprudence.)\n\"Where polygamy exists, it is sometimes the chiefs who are permitted to have a plurality of wives. Besides, just as in the case of polyandry, almost everywhere it is confined to a very small part of the people, the majority being monogamous. It is so among all Muhammadan people, in Asia and Europe, as well as in Africa.' 'Ninety-five per cent of the Muhammadans of India, for instance, are said to be monogamists,' and in Persia, it is reported, only two per cent of the population enjoy the questionable luxury of 'plurality of wives.\"\n(Howard-History of Matrimonial Institutions.)\n\"He (Muhammad) restrained polygamy by limiting the maximum number of contemporaneous marriages and by making absolute equity towards all obligatory for the man. It is worthy of note that the clause in the Quran, which contains the permission to contract four contemporaneous marriages is immediately followed by a sentence which cuts down the significance of the preceding passage to its normal and legitimate dimensions. The former passage says: 'you may marry two three of four wives but no more'. The subsequent lines declare: 'But if you cannot deal equitably and justly with all, you shall marry only one.' The extreme importance of this provision bearing especially in mind the meaning which is attached to the word equity (adl) in the Quranic teachings, has not been lost sight of by the great thinkers of the Muslim world.\"\n(Ameer Ali-Muhammadan Law)\n\"The Muhammadan law undoubtedly contemplates monogamy as the ideal to be aimed at, but concedes to a man the right to have more than one wife, not exceeding four, at one and the same time, provided he is able to deal with them on a footing of equality and justice. This is in accord with the scheme of Islamic legislation which sets up certain moral ideals to be gradually realised by the community, positively forbidding only such acts as must clearly be injurious to social and individual life at all times.\"\n(Abdur Rahim).\nVerse 177 of al-Baqarah says that piety does not lie in turning the face to east or west-piety lies (among other deeds mentioned therein) in \"freeing the slaves\", therefore, the application of what your right hands own\" has become, step by step, beyond the bounds of possibility.\nIn verse 195 of Ali Imran the parenthetical phrase \"one of you from the other\" makes it clear that men and women are counter-parts to each other and of the same human status.\nIn the end we quote below verse 129 of this surah which is self-explanatory:\nHowsoever you may try you will never be able to treat your wives justly. But do not incline (to one) exclusively and leave (the other) . suspended (as it were). Yet if you effect a reconciliation and safeguard yourselves with full awareness of divine laws, Allah is oftforgiving, merciful.\nConcisely, Islam, in unequivocal terms, though indirectly, deprecates polygamy.\n"

Please refer to the commentary of al-Baqarah: 30 to 39 and 124; and al-Ma-idah: 55 and 56 and 3 and 67 with reference to the event at Ghadir Khum; and al-Rad: 43; and al-Hud: 17. A careful study of the above references discloses that Ali, and after him, the remaining eleven Imams, in the progeny of the Holy Prophet, Ali and Fatimah, are the true successors of the Holy Prophet who have been referred to as ulil amr in this verse. So the Shias obey and follow the Holy Prophet and the twelve Imams.\nIt is irrational and senseless to accept any ruler as ulil amr, otherwise men like Yazid bin Mu-awiya will have to be included in the category of ulil amr; and no sane person would say that Allah has enjoined to obey men like Yazid (prototypes of whom were and are many and in abundance since the departure of the Holy Prophet till today) just as one obeys Allah and the Holy Prophet.\nFrom the event of ashira (feast of the near relatives to carry out the divine command of \"warn your tribe of near relatives\") to the day at Ghadir Khum, the Holy Prophet repeatedly announced the successorship of Ali, therefore, the first step a true Muslim must take to obey the messenger of Allah is to obey and follow Ali ibn abi Talib. Also refer to the \"Right Path\" and \"Peshawar Nights\", published by the Peermohammed Ebrahim Trust or Zahra Publications, because the issue of ulil amr and wali has been discussed in depth in these books with authentic references from the well-known books of tafsir (exegesis) and hadith (traditions) written by the Muslim scholars.\nToday the Muslim ummah (from Indonesia to Morocco) is in a quandary, because the theoreticians who directly or indirectly served the interests of the despotic rulers, have presented \"the obedience to ruler\" (even if he is an usurper, a rogue or a ruffian) as a fundamental of religion (known as the theory of ghlu and ghalba-violence and conquest) by misinterpreting this verse. Such theoreticians are their Imams. There is no way leading to emancipation from terror and exploitation if this theory is not rightly rejected once and for all.

Please refer to the commentary of al-Ma-idah: 67.\nThe companions of the Holy Prophet, after him, in a great hurry, held conferences in Saqifa bani Sa-ida to choose his successor, by ignoring his clear directions, inspite of this verse. It was a deliberate scheme to deprive the Muslim ummah from the divinely decreed leadership of Ali and his descendants. By doing so they not only violated the commands of Allah and the directions of the Holy Prophet but also condemned the Muslim ummah to an everlasting perdition.\nThere are two groups of the Holy Prophet's successors:\n(1) The twelve Imams, the descendants of Ibrahim, Ismail and the Holy Prophet, well-known to the Muslim ummah, from Imam Ali ibn abi Talib to Imam Muhammad bin Hasan al-Mahdi (refer to the commentary of al-Baqarah: 124).\n(2) The crafty rulers openly opposed and persecuted the twelve Imams and their families, friends and followers. Most of them were drunkards, gamblers and ruffians. To know the true colour of the Umayyid and Abbaside caliphs please refer to Hitti's History of the Arabs or any important book of history written by a Muslim or a non-Muslim historian.\nThe sincere seekers of truth can easily select their Imams whom they want to follow from among these two groups.\nIt was the misfortune of the Muslim ummah that they made a wrong decision after the departure of the Holy Prophet. Even at the last moment he asked his companions to bring a sheet of paper and a pen so that he could write that which would prevent them from going astray, after him, but the people around him did not want him to commit his will in writing. One of them said:\n\"The book of Allah is sufficient for us.\"\n(Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Fat-hul Bari, Tabrani, Tarikh Ahmadi).\nThis declaration by one of the companions, who also observed that \"the old man was in a delirium\" was a wilful contravention of this and many such verses of the Quran, because we cannot say that he was an ignorant fool who was not aware of the book of Allah.\nThe above-noted tradition is known as hadith al-qartas.\nWe again invite our readers to study pages 1 to 7, the commentary of al-Baqarah: 30 to 39; 124, 248, 249, 251; al-Ma-idah: 67 and of many verses in this book to know the fact that Imam Ali was the only true successor of the Holy Prophet, and after Imam Ali, his descendants upto Imam Muhammad bin Hasan al-Mahdi.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 4:101]\nThis verse refers to salat ul khawf (offering of salat while facing an enemy in a battle) and salat ul qasr (offering of salat during a journey)- curtailing the salat (zuhr, asr and isha) by half. The journey should be for a lawful purpose and for not less than (nearly) 27 miles. For details refer to books o fiqh.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nLaysa alaykum junah or la junaha (used in several verses of the Quran) signifies the negation of obligation, but the Holy Prophet had acted as if it was an obligation, as per verse 158 of al-Baqarah. So salatul khawf and salatul qasr must be prayed in its curtailed form.\nThe conditional clause (if you fear) pertains to the form of prayer to be offered when there is imminent danger of an enemy attack, because the first part of the verse has already dealt with the form of prayer prescribed for a traveller. It must also be noted that the conditional clause does not restrict the order (to curtail prayer) to the circumstances of fear, because there was \"fear\" at that time at all hours. It is like the phrase in verse 23 of this surah which does not restrict the prohibition.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 4:102]\nVerse 102 lays down the method of offering congregational salat when an attack by the enemy is imminent. Even in such moments of danger, prayer can not be put off. So pre-eminently important the duty of offering salat is in the code of Islam that it must be offered in every circumstance and at the appointed hours. The religion of a faithful is continually present with him. It brings the individual (his self) into closer touch with his Lord, and his self escapes from enslavement to freedom. On the 10th of Muharram in 61 Hijra, Imam Husayn, while offering the dhibhin azim (see commentary of al-Saffat: 107), translated the ordinance of this verse into action. For three days the Imam, his friends and relatives were without food and water. From all sides they were surrounded by the enemy. At dawn the Imam asked his son Ali Akbar to recite the azan. Tayammum was performed. The Holy Imam led the congregational fajr salat. The devotees who stood in front of the Imam to guard the prayers fell on the ground when arrows shot by the enemy hit them. In the evening, the holy Imam was alone, every pore of his body a bleeding wound, he slid over the burning sand of Naynawa from his horse, and prayed the asr salat. Swords, arrows, spears, daggers, lances, stones hit him from all directions. The sacred blood of Muhammad, Ali and Fatimah flowed (from the Imam's body) in a stream over the sandy soil.\nAt Hudaybiyah the Muslims were fighting against the advance troopers of the infidels, commanded by Khalid bin Walid. The Holy Prophet asked Bilal to recite azan for zuhr prayers. When the salat was completed Khalid regreted very much to have missed the golden opportunity of attacking the Muslims while they were praying, and decided not to do it again next time. Through this verse Allah asked the Holy Prophet to adopt the method mentioned in it in future under such circumstances.\nDo not infringe the prescribed law of prayer in any of its details. When out of danger or not journeying pray the salat in its proper, regular form as duly prescribed.\nKitaban mawqutan means it must be offered at appointed hours in every circumstance. The obligatory prayers are unavoidable so far as man is in possession of his senses.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 4:105]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nBashir, Mubashshir and Bashr, the sons of Ta-ma of Ubayraq tribe, had stolen some items from the house of the uncle of Qatada, and concealed them in the house of a Jew. When the theft was detected they put the blame on the Jew. Although the Jews were actively hostile to the Holy Prophet, he upheld the cause of justice, acquitted the accused Jew, and announced the three Muslim brothers guilty of theft. Justice has to be strictly applied whether the crime is committed by a friend or a foe. It was a time when every individual was very important for the small community of the Muslims. The tribe of Ubayraq was a large clan. Yet the Holy Prophet put justice above the exigencies of diplomacy.\nThe plural pronoun in verse 109 makes it clear that in verse 106 the Muslims have been asked, through the Holy Prophet, to beg forgiveness of Allah for expecting favouritism from the Holy Prophet. Verse 108 refers to the men of the tribe of Ubayraq who went to the Holy Prophet to plead for the offenders. Verse 107 clearly lays down the principle that there should be no pleading for those who deceive their own selves, because Allah does not love the treacherous and the iniquitous. People may support such offenders in this world but on the day of judgement no one will be able to plead for them. They will burn in hell for ever.\nMany Muslims respect Yazid (and despots like him) as the rightful caliph (khalifatullah) although he was a Shaytan in human form, who mercilessly killed and destroyed the beloved children of the Holy Prophet. His supporters argue that the Holy Prophet may ask Allah's forgiveness for him and the despots like him. Verse 6 of al-Munafiqun says:\n\"Whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask, it is all the same; Allah will not forgive them.\"\nThe verdict of Allah is clear. To imagine that the tyrants will be pardoned, inspite of the expressed decree of the almighty Lord, is the worst type of hypocrisy.\nIf man turns to Allah and remembers Him in any condition of fear, shame or hope, mindful of eternal joy and pain, it develops an inner preventive force to combat the urge and tendency to commit individual or collective crimes. Verses 110 and 11 I say that the door of repentance, in order to seek forgiveness, is open for those who hurt their own selves, not others. He who earns the wages of sin does so for himself. No one shall bear the burden of another. Verse 112 refers to the offenders of Ubayraq tribe and lays down the principle that he who commits a mistake or iniquity (even if Muslim) and ascribes it to one who is innocent (even if non-Muslim) is guilty of calumny and brazen sin.\nVerse 113 refers to the subterfuge the people of Ubayraq employed to mislead the Holy Prophet. The \"book and wisdom\" was with the Holy Prophet at all times. There is no interval of time in His giving existence to the Holy Prophet and bestowing the \"book and wisdom\" on him. Verse 2 of al-Najm and verse 7 of al-Duha confirm it.\nIn Najm: 7 the fa implies that there is no lapse of time between finding and guiding a being.\nVerse 114 refers to the event mentioned in verse 105. The hypocrites in their counsels mostly talked in whispers because they knew that they were supporting falsehood; and the faithful openly talked of charity and goodness in their gatherings.\n"

All commentators agree that in certain circumstances by giving the form of the possessive and objective case to the verb and the nominative case vice versa, it will receive a distinction for the sake of emphasis. According to a tradition A-isha observed that this is one of the mistakes committed by the scribes who wrote the Quran under the supervision of a committee appointed by Uthman but she and other companions, who used to criticise the government for less important issues did not object to it.\nFor awhina see commentary of al-Fatihah: 7.\nThe word Kama implies that in essence the revelation revealed to the Holy Prophet was similar to that which was revealed to other prophets and that he had the experience of all the specific forms and the manners of the revelations used separately for the earlier prophets (see commentary of al-Baqarah: 253). Qaba qawsayni aw adna (two bows or nearer) in verse 9 of al-Najm puts the Holy Prophet on the highest pedestal of the nearest nearness to Allah.\nThe well-known Persian poet Rumi says:\nThe holy name of Ahmed bears all the names of the prophets. Since the hundred-per-cent (out-and-out) has come, the lesser than that is certainly with us.\n"

Islam means complete surrender and submission to the divine will manifested through the sayings and doings of the Holy Prophet, because \"He does not speak of his own will; it is naught but revelation revealed\" (Najm: 2, 3); and verse 7 of al Hashr enjoins upon the believers: \"whatever the Holy Prophet gives you accept it; and whatever he forbids, abstain from it.\"\nThere are covenants which constitute the basis of the religion of Allah-belief in Allah, His prophets, His books, His guidance, His justice; and the covenant taken by the Holy Prophet on the day of Ghadir Khum (see commentary of al Ma-idah: 67). The divine guidance made available to mankind (from His mercy and grace), without which the din of Allah would have not been found in its true and original colour, has been clearly made known by the Holy Prophet in his last pronouncement known as hadith al thaqalayn.\nAccording to the Ahl ul Bayt the covenants referred to in this verse are those taken by the Holy Prophet from his followers on various occasions to follow and obey the holy Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt after the conclusion of his risalat.\nPlease refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 196 for \"unlawful during hajj is game\".

Please study the event of Ghadir Khum in the commentary of verse 67 of this surah.\nAhmad bin Hanbal, the founder of Hanbali sect, writes in his Musnad that a Jew had told the second caliph: \"If there were a similar declaration in the Pentateuch, the Jews would have celebrated the day as a great festival.\"\nThis verse is also a clear testimony to the perfection of the religion of Islam. Please refer to the commentary of al Fatihah: 7.\nAllah has completed and perfected Islam only when, under His command (Ma-idah: 67), the Holy Prophet had announced the imamat of Ali after the termination of risalat-he being the last messenger of Allah. Fakhruddin Razi has said that the Holy Prophet died 81 or 82 days after the revelation of this verse. All authorities agree that no law-giving verse was revealed after this verse. So without believing in Ali as the immediate successor of the Holy Prophet, according to this verse, the faith is neither complete nor perfect. The institution of imamat is necessary to keep intact the final word of Allah (the Quran) and to guide mankind unto the right path till the day of resurrection.\nAs verse 67 of this surah is inevitably connected with this verse, please study its commentary very carefully. To avoid repetition, all the historical, logical and rational arguments with authentic references pertaining to the imamah of Ali and his descendants mentioned in verse 67 of this surah have not been related here. This verse should be read as an immediate corollary of verse 67 of this surah.\nThis fact stands confirmed by a large number of non-Shia scholars, therefore, if any tradition contrary to this fact is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim, based upon diplomacy and political pressures, should be reviewed in the light of the bias and hostility they, and men like them, display whenever they deal with the merits of the Ahl ul Bayt. Please refer to Peshawar Nights, a well-known book published by Peermahomed Ebrahim Trust and Zahra Publications.\nIn the first verse of this surah it is said: \"Verily Allah commands whatsoever He intends\". So there is no sense in questioning the will of Allah if He intermingles various issues in any chapter, or in one verse, or two closely connected verses, or passages are placed away from each other. This arrangement was made by the Holy Prophet in his own lifetime. Please refer to \"Genuineness of the Quran\" (by Aqa Mahdi Puya) in this book.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAfter islama dina, fa, in faman, connects its following clause to the prohibitory clause preceding alyawma to islama dina, making the two clauses in alyawma to islama dina parenthetical. In its esoteric significance fa may be connected with the immediately preceding clauses to mean that Islam in its true form is that which was made known at Ghadir Khum in pursuance of verse 67 of this surah.\n"

The Quran refers to such instances to warn the Muslims to avoid disobedience displayed by the Jews in similar circumstances .\nThe following extract is given from Milman's History of the Jews:-\n\"At length the nation arrived on the southern frontier of the promised land (Vr. 21 ) . Twelve spies, one from each tribe, are sent out to make observations on the fruitfulness of the land, the character of the inhabitants and the strength of their fortifications. Among these the most distinguished are Caleb of the tribe of Judah and Joshua of Ephraim-In one respect their report is most satisfactory: Canaan had undergone vast improvements, since the time when Abraham and Isaac had pastured their flocks in the open and unoccupied plains. But on the other hand, the intelligence, exaggerated by the fears of the rest of the twelve spies, overwhelms the people with terror. Their treasures were guarded by fierce and warlike tribes, not likely to abandon their native plains without an obstinate bloody conquest. Their cities were strongly fortified, and above all the first enemies they would have to encounter would be men of colossal stature, the descendants of the gigantic people, celebrated in their early national traditions, people before whom they would be grasshoppers (Verse 22)-The confidence in the divine protection gave way at once before their sense of physical inferiority, and the total deficiency of moral courage, 'Back' to Egypt' is the general cry. The brave Joshua and Caleb in vain reprove the general pusillanimity (Verse 23); their own lives are in danger; and in bitter disappointment the great law-giver perceives that a people- inured to slavery from their birth, are not the z material from which he can construct a bold conquering and independent nation. (Verse 25)\nThe decision instantly formed-they are neither to return to Egypt nor assail an easier conquest; but . they are condemned to wander for a definite period of forty years, in the barren and dismal regions through which they had marched (Verse 26).\"\nSome quotations from the Old Testament are given below:\nThus their report to the Israelites about the land which they had explored was discouraging: \"The country we explored\", they said \"will swallow up any who go to live in it. All the people we saw there are men of gigantic size.\" (Numbers 13: 32)\nAnd two of those who had explored the land, Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, rent their clothes and addressed the whole community: \"The country we penetrated and explored\", they said, \"is very good land in deed. If the Lord is pleased with us, He will bring us into this land which flows with milk and honey, and give it to us. But you must not rebel against the Lord. You need not fear the people of the land; for there we shall find food. They have lost the protection that they had; the Lord is with us. (Numbers 14: 6 to 9)\n \nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nOnly two God-fearing men (Joshua and Caleb), from among the several followers of Musa, believed in Allah and His Prophet and relied upon them. Similarly a large majority of the Muslims, present at Ghadir Khum also turned disloyal to the covenant they bound themselves with on that day and till the day of zahur (appearance of the living Imam and Isa) their followers shall continue to do as the Jews and their own leaders did.\nIn Minhaj us Sadiqin it is stated that rabbuka before faqatila (fight you two) implies Harun because he was the elder brother of Musa, which has been made clear in verse 25 when Musa mentions the name of Harun.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe impertinent disobedience of the Muslims to the order of the Holy Prophet to march under the command of Usamah, or of some of the companions to his order to bring paper and pen (hadith al qirtas), bears similarity to the conduct of the followers of Musa. Not only the paper and pen demanded by the Holy Prophet was not provided to him but also it was observed that the old man (Holy Prophet) was in a delirium, uttering nonsense. Like Musa the Holy Prophet said:\nGo away. Leave me alone.\nThe forty years wandering of the Bani Israil lasted, according to Sir Charles Marston's computation, from 1440 B.C. to 1400 B.C.\nRefer to Numbers 14: 29 to 34.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe wandering of the children of Israil was for forty years, but the wandering of those who have broken the covenant made at Ghadir Khum shall last till the reappearance of the last Imam of the house of the Holy Prophet.\n\"Do not grieve for (these) rebellious people.\" shows that Musa, inspite of all the injuries and slanders heaped upon him, pitied his rebellious people, and was moved at their miseries.\n"

Thereupon Adam asked each of them to offer a sacrifice to Allah separately so that Allah might accept the sacrifice of one whom He found deserving to succeed him. Habil was a shepherd and Qabil a tiller of the soil. Habil brought the best of his flock as a gift to the Lord; and Qabil brought some dried up ears of corn. Allah received Habil's gift with favour; but He did not receive Qabil's gift. Qabil was very angry and his face fell. He attacked his brother Habil and murdered him. As this was the first murder, in fact, first human death, Qabil did not know what to do with the corpse and stood puzzled. A raven was sent by Allah to show him how to bury a dead body. Adam was greatly disturbed. Allah had granted him another son, Shith, in place of Habil. Shith, a prophet of Allah, succeeded Adam. Qabil's descendants were drowned when the waters of the great flood came upon the earth in the days of Nuh.\nAllah only accepts sacrifice from those who are pious and safeguard themselves against evil with full awareness of Allah's laws.

Adultery destroys purity of character and rends asunder the peace and harmony of human society. Thievery upsets the social and economic structure of the social life of a community. It snatches away happiness from the people and exposes them to misery. Therefore, these two crimes have been particularly underlined for severe punishment. The penalty prescribed in this verse is a divine statute, and is not to be taken lightly. Adultery and thievery are the \"hallmark\" of modern (so-called) civilised nations.

He who professed the faith with his mouth in the presence of the Holy Prophet was not a believer. Such hypocrites, after the Holy Prophet, persecuted his Ahl ul Bayt, usurped their rights, and killed them. They have been grouped with the Jews who used to give ear to lies, spy on behalf of others and distort the words of God out of context (see commentary of al Baqarah: 75 to 79 and 104). They only agreed with that which was mentioned in their corrupted books.\nAccording to an agreement between the two Jewish tribes of Madina (Bani Nadhir and Bani Qurayza) if a man of Bani Nadhir killed a man of Bani Qurayza, he would only pay half of the blood-money and would be paraded in the streets sitting on a camel with his face towards its tail On the other hand the murderer from the Bani Qurayza would pay full blood-money and would also face death if he killed any one of the Bani Nadhir tribe. This unjust arrangement was imposed on Bani Qurayza with the help of Abdullah bin Obayy. After the arrival of the Holy Prophet in Madina, a case of murder was referred to him for arbitration by both the tribes because the murderer, who belonged to Bani Qurayza, refused to comply with the terms of the unjust agreement which, his tribe declared, was against the law of Musa. The tribe of Bani Nadhir tried to influence the Holy Prophet through Abdullah bin Obay for obtaining his judgement in their favour, with the reservation that if he did not oblige them his judgement would not be accepted. It is reported that on that occasion this verse was revealed.\nPlease refer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 23 for the judgement the Holy Prophet gave in a case of adultery according to the law of Musa. The choice whether to act as an arbitrator in the suits and disputes of the Jews, devourers of gains through unlawful means, entirely lay with the Holy Prophet. The Madinite Jews, true to their traditions of mischief, sometimes submitted their disputes to the Holy Prophet for decision to test and try his knowledge of their law.\nThey did not approach him as bonafide seekers of justice, with any honest motives at all, because they declined to abide by the decision of the Holy Prophet, made in the light of the law of Musa, whenever it went against them.\n"

This verse does not testify the integrity of the corrupted book the Jews now refer to as their revealed book, known as the Old Testament (refer to \"The Tawrat\" at the end of al-Ma-idah). The rabbis and priests were the witnesses of Allah's writ because they had memorised and kept safe (istahfizu- from hifz) the true text of the original book.\nIt should be noted that although the original Tawrat had been corrupted by the Jews but some important and basic essentials were kept safe in the memory of some of their honest scholars; whereas Allah Himself has taken the responsibility of keeping the Quran in original form without any additions or omissions (Hijr: 9). The declaration of the Holy Prophet (refer to hadith al thaqalayn on page 6) points to the divinely chosen custodians of the book of Allah.\n\"Those who do not judge by Allah's revelations are disbelievers indeed\" applies also to those Muslims who do not follow the verdict given in verse 65 of an Nisa-unconditional obedience to whatever the Holy Prophet decided. Many of them failed to adhere to his declaration at Ghadir Khum. They neither listened to his advice of \"remaining attached to his Ahl ul Bayt and the Quran\", nor accepted Ali as his successor; on the contrary they quarrelled among themselves on the issue of his successorship by putting forward their own arguments in Saqifa bani Sa-ida, notwithstanding his clear guidance given to them a few months before at Ghadir Khum.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nOnly the prophets and the pious divines who had submitted to Allah, were entrusted with the responsibility of giving judgements according to the Tawrat. The people had no right to use their discretion. Likewise the Quran was not abandoned to the eccentric and unreliable evaluation of common people as wrongly concluded by a group of the Holy Prophet's companions who believed in hasbuna kitabullah (sufficient for us is the book of Allah). On the contrary the Holy Prophet joined his Ahl ul Bayt with the Quran as the infallible guardians of its integrity, meanings and application (hadith al thaqalayn). There is no doubt about its genuineness. It has been kept safe from corruption. Allah, the Holy Prophet and his Ahl Bayt have preserved its originality for the guidance of mankind till the end of the world. Through the Quran the other heavenly scriptures have also been preserved. Therefore, their original and true texts will be made known to the people by the awaited holy Imam in order to expose the corrupted and distorted editions of these two holy books, the Jews and the Christian present before the world as the word of God.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 5:54]\nA careful study of verses 54 and 55 indicates that they have no relation with the preceding verses prohibiting friendship with infidels. The subject matter of verse 54 is quite different. It is in praise of Ali, about his nomination to political and religious leadership; and wherein the renegades have been warned of his might and valour, and frightened of his great overwhelming influence.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"The resolute co-operation among the Quraysh will not dissipate unless Allah appoints over you a man whose heart Allah has tested through severe trial of faith. He will strike your necks and you will be as afraid of him as frightened sheep.\"\nWhereupon Abu Bakr inquired if he was that man and Umar inquired if he was that man. The Holy Prophet replied: \"No. But the person who is mending shoes inside the room is that man.\" And Ali turned up with shoes in his hand which he was repairing for the Holy Prophet.\nMany traditionists have recorded it with slight variations-Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Musnad, Hakim in his Mustadrak, Abu Yala in his Musnad, and Muttaqi in his Kanz al Ummal.\nIt is a warning about Ali's might, as explained by himself on the day of the battle of Jamal. Tha-labi has mentioned it in his Tafsir and the compiler of Majma al Bayan has reproduced it as related by Ammar, Hudhayfah and Ibn Abbas. This becomes clearer when we notice the fact that verse 55 (innama waliyukum) follows this verse, wherein Allah has suggested His superior authority and hinted at the necessity of Ali's leadership (imamat). Verse 55 explains and clarifies the reference in verse 54.\n\"In the battle of Khaybar the second caliph (like other companions) tried to conquer the fort, but took to flight when the Jew soldiers overpowered his contingent. Before the Holy Prophet they blamed each other for showing cowardice in the battlefield.\"\n(Tarikh Tabari Vol. 2; page 300)\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Certainly (the next morning) I will send the man whom Allah will never put to shame, who loves Allah and His messenger and is equally loved by Allah and His messenger.\"\nUtter disappointment was the lot of many a companion who yearned for this distinction - \"Allah shall bring a people whom He shall love and who shall love Him\", as has been clearly pointed out in this verse. Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Musnad, vol. 1, p. 330; Nisa-i in Khasa-is al Alawiyyah, p. 6; Hakim in his Mustadrak, Vol. 3, p. 123; and Dhahabi in his Talkhis have recorded this tradition in the \"ten excellent merits\" of Ali, not possessed by anybody else.\n\"Striving hard in the way of Allah\", refers to no one but Ali, who, in all the battles fought by the Holy Prophet (Badr, Uhad, Khandaq, Khaybar and others-refer to authentic books of history written by well-known Muslim scholars), not only defeated and destroyed the enemies of Allah but demolished their power base beyond recovery.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe qualities, mentioned in this verse and verse 29 of al Fat-h (according to well-known traditions written in Sahihs, Musnads and Tafsirs), were owned by no one but Ali. In all the battles fought by the Holy Prophet against the enemies of Allah, the Shaykhayn (the first caliph and the second caliph) never played a decisive role in any battle, nor won victory in single combats or general confrontations; on the contrary they were always either overpowered or ran away from the scene of action. More often they did not carry out the orders given to them by the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet knew that Dhith-Thadiyyah was an apostate, so he asked the Shaykhayn to kill him, but they disobeyed and spared his life; and it was this renegade who, according to Sahih Bukhari and others, became the leader of the Khawarij, and was finally killed by Ali in the battle of Nahrawan.\nNo doubt the Shaykhan and their adherents were severe and hard against the Ahl ul Bayt and their followers .\n\"Allah shall bring a people\", refers to those who, later on, gathered under the banner of Ali (whose qualities have been clearly described in this verse and verse 29 of al Fat-h), in the battles of Jamal, Siffin and Nahrawan. When Ammar ibn Yasir was asked as to how could he fight against the people who professed Islam, he replied: \"We fight under the banner of Ali against those who are under the banner of Mu-awiyah, in keeping with the Quran. They professed Islam but concealed infidelity in their hearts, and have now come out\nin their true colour of apostasy.\" The followers of Ali strive hard in the way of Allah, not fearing the criticism of the apostates. The devotees of the other Imams of Ahl ul Bayt also come in this category, and according to many commentators of all schools of thought in Islam (Majma ul Bayan) at the time of the reappearance of Imam al Mahdi the world will witness the true interpretation of these phrases of the Quran.\nThe Muslims did not oppose the actions taken against the apostates in the times of the Shaykhayn, but they criticised Ali ibn abi Talib for fighting against A-isha and Mu-awiyah; therefore, this verse refers only to Ali and his devotees.\nThere is no historical evidence to prove that the Holy Prophet ever referred to any fight by Abu Bakr, Umar or Uthman against the apostates, but he had predicted Ali's fight against three types of apostates-nakithin (oath-breakers), qasitin (wrong-doers), maraqin (strayed ones). It was also foretold by him that Ammar Yasir would be killed by a group of insurgents.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 5:55]\nAll the commentators unanimously hold, as Qushaji admits in the Sharh al Tajrid on the subject of imamat, that this verse refers to Ali when he gave his ring to a beggar while bowing down in the course of his prayers. Nasa-i has also recorded this tradition in his Sahihah al Nasa-i, and so has the author of Al Jama Bayn al Sihah al Sittah (corroboration of the six authentic books) in discussion of the commentary on al Ma-idah, and so does Tha-labi in his Tafsir Kabir, and al Balakhi in his Yanabi has copied it from Ahmad bin Hanbal's Musnad, vol. 5, margin of p. 38. Please refer to the commentary on this verse in Wahidi's book Asbab al Nuzul (the circumstances of descent) which contains the tradition related by Ibn Abbas. Al Khatib has recorded the tradition in Al Muttafiq, and Ibn Marduwayh and Abu Shaykh in their Musnads. It is mentioned in Kanz al Ummal, vol. 6, p. 391, tradition no. 5991. In Ghayah al Maram, chapter 18, there are twenty four traditions from sources other than the Ahl ul Bayt, all supporting the above statement about the descent of this verse.\nWhen Abi Ishaq Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Naysaburi al Tha-labi reached this verse he recorded the following in his Tafsir al Kabir on the authority of Abu Dharr al Ghifari, who said \"Both of my ears may turn deaf and both my eyes may become blind if I speak a lie. I heard the Holy Prophet saying, 'Ali is the guide of the righteous and the slayer of the infidels. He who has helped him is victorious and he who has abandoned him is forsaken'. One day I said my prayers in the company of the Holy Prophet; a beggar came to the masjid and begged for alms, but nobody gave him anything. Ali was in a state of ruku in the prayer. He pointed out his ring to the beggar, who approached him and removed the ring from his finger. Thereupon the Holy Prophet implored Allah, saying: 'O Allah! My brother Musa begged You saying: My Lord, delight my heart and make my task easy and undo the knot in my tongue so that they may understand me, and appoint from among my kinsmen, Harun, my brother, as my vizier, and strengthen my back with him and make him participate in my mission so that we may glorify You and remember You more frequently. Certainly You see us-and You inspired him: O Musa! All your requests have been granted. (The Holy Prophet continued) Delight my heart and make my task easy and appoint from among my kinsmen Ali as my vizier and strengthen my back with him'. (Abu Dhar proceeds) By Allah, the Holy Prophet had not yet finished his supplication when the trustworthy Jibril descended to him with this verse\". (Ibn Khallikan says that Al Tha-labi was unique as a commentator of the Quran and his Tafsir al Kabir is superior to all other Tafsirs).\nIn this verse the word wali has been used in the meaning of guardian or master or who holds authority superior to others. Please refer to the origin of the word wali in Sihah or Mukhtar al Sihah or any other good dictionary. The lexicographers have explained that he who manages the affairs of and exercises authority for another person is the wali of that person. This verse, therefore, means that those who manage the affairs of the people (mankind) are superior to all men, and certainly they are Allah, His messenger, the Holy Prophet, and Ali, who possesses all the qualifications enumerated in this verse. Allah has simultaneously confirmed His wilayah (superior authority), that of His prophet and his wali (Ali) in unbroken succession. Allah's wilayah is universal, so likewise, the wilayah of the Holy Prophet and his wali (Ali) must be so. It is not possible to assign to the word wali in this verse the meaning of a helper or a friend, etcetera, for help and friendship are not confined to these three only. All the faithful men and women, according to the holy book, are friends and helpers of one another. It is as obvious as can be that the word wali in this verse means, guardian, ruler, possessor of superior authority. It is in this sense that the word wali has been used by the Holy Prophet in the abovenoted tradition related by Al Tha-labi in his Tafsir al Kabir on the authority of Abu Dharr al Ghifari whom the Holy Prophet had given the title of siddiq (the truthful). There are other authentic traditions, given below, in which the word wali indicates its true meaning:\n(i) Abu Dawud al Tayalisi has recorded in Isti-ab on the authority of Ibn Abbas, who said: \"The Holy Prophet said to Ali, 'You are the master (wali) of the faithful after me'.\"\n(ii) After an expedition, under the command of Ali, some of the men, who went with him, complained to the Holy Prophet about Ali's refusal to oblige them favourably. The Holy Prophet turned to them with signs of displeasure on his face and said: \"What do you want to do to Ali? Surely Ali is from me and I am from him, and after me he is the master (wali) of all the faithful.\"\nNasa-i has recorded it in his Khasa-is al Alawiyyah, p. 17, Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Musnad, vol. 4, p. 438; Hakim in Mustadrak, vol. 11, p. 11; Al Dhahabi in his Talkhis al Mustadrak; Ibn Shaybah and Jarir both have recorded it from whom Muttaqi of India has copied it in his Kanz al Ummal, vol. 6, p. 400; Tirmidhi has recorded it from Asqalani, mentioned in his account of Ali in his Isabah; Ibn Hadid has copied it from Tirmidhi in his Sharh al Nahj al Balagha, vol. 2, p. 450.\n(iii) The Holy Prophet said to Buraydah:\n\"Am I not a more privileged master (mawla or wali) of the lives of the faithful than the faithful themselves? Ali is the master (wali or mawla) of those who believe me to be their master.\"\nAhmad ibn Hanbal has recorded it in his Musnad, vol. 5, p. 356, Hakim has recorded it in his Mustadrak, vol. 3, p. 110, besides many other traditionists.\n(iv) The Holy Prophet said:\n\"O Ali! After me you are the master of all the faithful.\"\nHakim has recorded this tradition as reported by Ibn Abbas in his Mustadrak, vol. 3, p. 134; and Dhahabi in his Talkhis; Nasa-i in Khasa-is al Alawiyyah p. 6; Ahmad ibn Hanbal in Musnad vol. 1, p. 331.\n\"Ali is your wali after me\", means that Ali and none else will be the master of the faithful after the Holy Prophet. It confines in Ali the authority to manage the affairs of the ummah after him. It is, therefore, necessary to attach the same meaning to the word wali and to understand it in the same sense as has been pointed out above. Help, affection, love, friendship are not confined to any one person. All faithful men and women love and are friends of one another. If the meaning of wali is taken as helper or friend, then why the Holy Prophet took so much interest in, and attached so much importance to, clarifying emphatically what was obvious and evident, so as to repeat the declaration off and on? His perfect wisdom, his thorough impeccability and termination with him of the prophethood make him far above the indulgence of explaining the self-evident, emphasising the obvious and making unnecessary repetitions. Besides, the traditions lay down clearly that Ali is or will be master of the nation after the Holy Prophet, and this makes it all the more necessary to understand the word wali in the same sense and fix for it the same meaning as has been stated above. The abovenoted traditionists, commentators and historians also deal with the word wali or mawla as the \"more privileged master of the lives of the faithful than the faithful themselves.\"\n\"Those who believe\" is in the plural form. How can it be applicable to an individual?\nAll the annotators, traditionists and historians agree that it was Na-im ibn Mas-ud al Ashja-i, whom Abu Sufyan gave ten camels for discouraging the Muslim, said to them: \"Fear your enemies who have united against you and gathered in large numbers to attack you\" (Ali Imran: 173), but in this verse \"people said to them\" (a plural form) has been used.\nIt was Ghawrath from the tribe of Banu Maharib, some scholars say, while others say that it was Umar ibn Jahash of the tribe of Banu Nadir, (a single man) single man) who drew out his sword to strike the Holy Prophet, but verse 11 of al Ma-idah describes it as \"when a group of persons became so bold as to stretch their hands to you\"-in plural form. Verse 120 of al Nahl says: \"Ibrahim was certainly a people obedient to Allah\".\nThere are plenty of other examples of using the plural form for an individual.\nTabrasi, while commenting on this verse in his Majma al Bayan, says: \"The plural form has been used for Ali in order to express his glory and eminence .\"\nZamakhshari, in his Tafsir al Kashshaf, says:\n\"If you inquire how this plural word is applicable to Ali, who is an individual, I shall say that though this verse is about Ali, an individual, the plural form is used in order to persuade others to act similarly and give alms as readily as Ali did.\"\nThe Imams among the Ahl ul Bayt have frequently referred to this verse as a proof of their rightful imamat and have assigned the same meaning to the word wali as we have stated.\nThe word innama makes the decision of Allah (that He, the Holy Prophet and Ali alone are the masters of the believers) final and decisive. The construction of the sentence and the word wali, used in singular for all the three, means that wilayah of all the three is essentially one in nature as well as in effect. Therefore, obedience to the Holy Prophet must be as it should be to Allah, and obedience to Ali and his successors (the Imams among the Ahl ul Bayt) must be as it should be to the Holy Prophet.\nWa hum raki-un is an adverbial clause qualifying the manner in which the alms were given. If it is taken as a conjunctive clause, then yuqimunas salat or this clause becomes an unnecessary repetition.\nIn fact this verse points out the highest state of spiritual attainment-fully absorbed in witnessing the glory of the absolute Lord and at the same time alive to the needs of His servants so as to solve them at once to their full satisfaction- which alone entitles a man to be a master like the eternal master, the almighty Allah. The Quran a asserts this possibility for such a man, not for all the followers because they have been addressed in\nsecond person (kum). The plural term \"those who believe\" is used to include the Imams among the Ahl ul Bayt in the same way as has been done in verse 61 of Ali Imran (Mubahilah).\nPlease also refer to verse 67 of this surah for the event of Ghadir Khum where the Holy Prophet openly declared Ali as the wali or mawla of the faithfuls just as the Holy Prophet himself is. The entire Muslim nation is unanimous that when the verses of the Quran were collected they were not arranged in the same order in which they descended. There is many a verse occurring in an irrelevant context, for instance, the verse of purification, which occurs in the account of the wives of the Holy Prophet, but actually is in praise of the five persons of al kisa, as has been universally admitted. All Muslims are agreed that arguments are to be preferred to the context, and whenever the implication of the context was opposed to the implication of arguments they ignored the context and yielded to the arguments, because they were doubtful about the context in which a certain verse occurs.\n"

Deliver what has been sent down unto you from your Lord; and if you do not, then you have not delivered His Message; and surely Allah will protect you from men.\"\n(MA-IDAH: 67)\nThe Holy Prophet mounted a tall pulpit and delivered a long sermon, recounting his services towards the fulfilment of his mission as the messenger of Allah. He asked the audience whether he had conveyed to them the commands of Allah, enumerating them one after another.\nThe huge gathering, in one voice, said \"yes\". \"Do I wield authority over your souls more than you do?\" He asked.\n\"Certainly it is so, O Messenger of Allah\" . They replied.\nThen he asked Ali to come up. He held him in both his hands, raised him high, so much that the whole assembly of men and women saw him clearly.\nHe again addressed them:\n\"O men and women! Allah is my Mawla (Lord-Master). I am the mawla of the faithfuls. I have a clear authority over their souls, And of whomsoever I am the mawla (this) Ali is his mawla. O Allah! Love him who loves Ali, hate him who hates Ali.\"\nAt the end of this declaration the following verse was revealed:\n\"This day I have perfected for you, your religion, and have completed my favour on you, and have chosen for you Islam, as religion.\"\n(MA-IDAH: 3)\nFor those whose minds are clouded with the doubts created over the years by the enemies of the Holy Prophet and his holy Ahl ul Bayt, there are sufficient references in the books written by their own scholars whom they acclaim with one voice.\nSeveral eminent traditionists have clearly stated it to be genuine. Even Ibn Hajar has admitted it to be genuine where he has copied the tradition from Tabarani and others; in Sawa-iq, sec. 5, chap. 1. p. 25.\nTabarani and others have recorded the following tradition as related by Zayd ibn Arqam and transmitted through sources unanimously acknowledged to be reliable. Zayd says that the Holy Prophet delivered a sermon at Ghadir Khum under a cloth spread as a canopy on two large trees. The Holy Prophet said:\n\"O my people! I am going to be recalled shortly and I must comply. I shall be interrogated and you also shall be interrogated. What will you say then?\" The entire audience answered: \"We shall bear witness that you did convey to us the message of Allah, and tried your best to guide us on the right path and always gave us good counsel. May Allah bless you with a good reward.\" The Holy Prophet proceeded: \"Why do you not bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and messenger, and that paradise is true, hell is true, death is true, resurrection after death is true, that the day of judgement will doubtlessly come and that Allah will raise to life the dead from their graves?\" They said: \"O Yes! We bear witness to all this.\" Then he said: \"O Allah! You also may witness.\" Then he said: \"O my people! Allah is my Mawla and I am mawla of the faithful and I have superior right on and control over their lives. And this Ali is the mawla of all those of whom I am mawla. O Allah! Love him who loves him and hate him who hates him.\" He further said: \"O my people! I will precede you, you also shall arrive at the pool of Kawthar, the pool wider than the distance between Basrah and Sana, and there are on the pool as many goblets of silver as stars. When you shall reach me I shall interrogate you about your behaviour towards the two invaluable assets after my death. The major asset is the book of Allah, one end of which is in the hand of Allah, and the other end in your hands. Grasp it tightly and do not go astray and do not change or amend it. The other asset is my progeny, who are my Ahl al Bayt. Allah has informed me that the two will not part from each other before they reach me at the pool.\"\nFirst of all he announced that the time of his death was fast approaching. This was a warning to the people that the time had come for the completion of his divine message and ensuring the future spiritual welfare of his followers by appointing his successor. This important matter brooked no delay, lest his death might arrive before properly establishing his successor in office.\nAs the appointment of his own brother (cousin) was very unpalatable for self-seekers, jealous and malicious persons, and the hypocrites, he thought it fit to appease their feelings and to calm their hearts by prefacing the declaration of appointment with \"I shall be interrogated,\" so that they might know that the Holy Prophet was in command from Allah to make this declaration and would be interrogated about discharging this important duty and, that there was no alternative.\nWahidi has stated in his book Asbab al Nuzul through reliable sources culminating with Abu Said al-Khudri that Chap. 5, Verse 67\" O Messenger; do proclaim what has descended upon you from your Lord\" descended at Ghadir Khum about Ali ibn Abu Talib.\nDaylami and others have recorded as related by Abu Said and as stated in Sawa-iq that the Holy Prophet said: \"Call them to a halt. They will be interrogated about the superior authority and guardianship of Ali.\" And Wahidi says: \"They will be interrogated about the superior authority and guardianship of Ali and the Ahl al Bayt.\"\nThis sermon calls for special attention. A careful perusal of it will reveal the truth that belief in the superior authority and guardianship of Ali is one of the fundamental principles of faith and this is what the Shi-as believe. The Holy Prophet first asked the audience to bear witness that Allah is the only God, that Muhammad is His slave and messenger, that the day of judgement is bound to come and that Allah will raise to life the dead from their graves. And when they had promised to bear witness to all these things and expressed their belief therein, he asked them to believe \"Ali to be wali, i.e. defender of the faith, supreme commander of the faithful and favourite of Allah,\" so that everybody might know that witnessing of belief in the wilayah of Ali was as important an article of faith as belief in the unity of Allah, the prophethood of Muhammad, the resurrection of the dead, and the day of judgement, and that he will be interrogated about it too. Anyone who follows the style of the sermon, the juxtaposition of sentences therein and the import of the words will reach the same unavoidable conclusion.\nMawla means master; lord; guardian; one more deserving of superior authority.\nThe words ana awla (I am superior) indicate that the word mawla means awla, i.e., superior. What the Holy Prophet meant by this sentence was, \"Allah is superior in right and might to him and he is superior in right and might to the faithful and Ali is superior in right and might to all those to whom the Holy Prophet is superior.\"\nThese are the words of Zayd ibn Arqam, who related the tradition. Tabarani, Ibn Jarir, Hakim and Tirmidhi all have recorded the tradition in identical words. Ibn Hajar has copied the tradition from Tabarani in his Sawa-iq, p. 25, and has stated that the tradition is accepted as genuine by all Muslims. Hakim has recorded in the chapter on the \"Virtues of Ali\" in Mustadrak (vol. 3, p. 109) this tradition as related by Zayd bin Arqam and transmitted through two different sources, and has stated that both the sources are reliable according to the standard set by Bukhari and Muslim. Hakim has recorded it also in the account of Zayd ibn Arqam in Mustadrak, vol. 3, p. 533, and held it to be genuine. In spite of his orthodoxy, Dhahabi has copied it from this chapter in his Talkhis from the account of Zayd.\nAhmad ibn Hanbal has recorded the tradition related by Zayd ibn Arqam (in his Musnad, vol. 4, p. 372). In Khasa-is al Alawiyyah, p. 21, Nasa-i has recorded this tradition as related by Zayd ibn Arqam.\nAbu Tufayl says: \"I asked Zayd if he had personally heard the Holy Prophet uttering the tradition related by him.\" Zayd replied: \"Everyone in the huge crowd saw the Holy Prophet with his own eyes and heard him (making the declaration) with his own ears.\"\nAbu Tufayl's question to Zayd indicates his surprise at the action of the Muslim nation in disregarding the imperative instructions of the Holy Prophet in respect to Ali, in spite of the reports concerning the declaration the Holy Prophet made on the day of Ghadir about the prior right of Ali and his superior authority over the lives of the faithful, similar to the prior right and superior authority over the lives of the faithful held by the Holy Prophet himself. He was either extremely doubtful about the genuineness of the tradition of Ghadir, because the nation had settled the question of succession of the Holy Prophet by vote of allegiance in glaring contradiction of the Holy Prophet's declaration, or astonished at the utter disregard by the followers of the Holy Prophet's important declaration. He therefore inquired if Zayd had himself heard the Holy Prophet making the declaration. Zayd ibn Arqam replied that in spite of there being a huge crowd of men on the occasion there was not a single person who could not see the Holy Prophet with his own eyes and hear his words with his own ears. Zayd's reply convinced him of the truth of what has been expressed by Kumayl, a prominent poet who composed poems in praise of Ali in the following lines:\n\"In the valley of Ghadir Khum the Holy Prophet had declared Ali to be his successor. Would that the nation had complied with the declaration.\nBut they decided the matter of succession by vote of allegiance; I have never witnessed casting a vote of allegiance about such an important matter.\nI have neither witnessed another day so important as the day of Ghadir;\nNor have I ever seen so serious a destruction of right.\"\nMuslim has also recorded this tradition in the chapter on the 'Virtues of Ali' in his Sahih (vol. 2 p. 325) as related by Zayd ibn Arqam and transmitted through several sources. But he has recorded it briefly in a curtailed form as men of his class are apt to do about such matters.\nAhmad ibn Hanbal has recorded the tradition related by Bara ibn Azib in his Musnad, vol. 4, p. 281, transmitted through two different sources.\nBara says: \"We were with the Messenger of Allah. \"We alighted at Ghadir Khum. Congregational prayer was in order. An area under two trees was swept and cleaned for the Holy Prophet. He offered midday prayers and he grasped the hand of Ali and said: 'Do you not know that I have greater authority over the lives of the faithful than the faithful themselves?\" \"Yes you have,\" they replied. He again inquired: \"'Do you not know that I have greater right to the life of every believer than the believer himself?\" \"Surely, you have,\" they answered. Then he grasped the hand of Ali and said: \"Ali is the mawla of all those of whom I am mawla. O Allah! Love him who loves him and hate him who hates him.\" Bara ibn Azib says: \"Then Umar came to Ali and said: 'Congratulations to you O the son of Abu Talib. You have become the mawla (master) of all the faithful men and women.\" Nasa-i has recorded a tradition related by A-ishah bint Sad, who says that she heard her father saying that on the day of Ghadir he heard the Holy Prophet delivering a sermon while holding the hand of Ali. He praised and eulogised Allah and then he said: \"O my people! I am your master.\" \"True it is, O messenger of Allah,\" they responded. Then he raised the hand of Ali and said: \"He is my wali, and he will repay my debts. I am a friend of him who loves him and an enemy of him who hates him.\"\nSad also relates that he was among the people accompanying the Holy Prophet. When he reached Ghadir Khum he ordered a halt and called back those who had preceded him and waited for those who were lagging behind. When all the people gathered there he said: \"O my people! Who is your wali (master)?\" \"Allah and His messenger,\" they said. Then he grasped the hand of Ali and caused him to stand and said: \"He is wali of whom Allah and His messenger are wali. O Allah! Love him who loves him and hate him who hates him.\"\nShibli Nu-mani in Siratun Nabi (completed by Sayyid Sulayman Nadvi) writes:\nWhile returning from Makka to Madina, after the last hajj, alongwith his companions, the Holy Prophet broke the journey at a lake, 3 miles away from Juhfa. A small lake is called ghadir in Arabic, so this place is known as Ghadir Khum. There, the Holy Pr"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 5:83]\nWhen the Holy Prophet began to preach in public at Makka, the Quraysh violently reacted against him. They insulted him in public, threw dust and dirt at him and over him while in prayers, made loud cries, hooted or sang wild songs to drown his voice while he was preaching; but to their discomfiture they could not prevent him. Finding all their efforts of no avail, they began to use violence against his followers. The Holy Prophet, therefore, advised his followers, who had no protection in Makka, to seek refuge elsewhere. Abyssinia was the place proposed for this purpose, and unanimously agreed upon. Accordingly, in the fifth year of bi-that (about 615 A.D.) one hundred and sixteen refugees, headed by Jafar bin Abu Talib, reached Abyssinia in safety, while the Holy Prophet and his family remained in Makka. Baffled by the Muslim converts escaping to Abyssinia, the Quraysh sent an embassy headed by Amru bin As and Abdullah bin abi Rabi-i with costly presents to the Christian King of Abyssinia, Najashi (Negus). Amru and Abdullah first prostrated themselves to pay Negus their respects, then explained that some of their tribes-men, having adopted a new faith which taught them to think lightly of Isa and Maryam, had forsaken their ancestral religion and escaped to his country. They requested the king, in the name of the Quraysh chiefs, that the fugitives might be delivered up to them. The king sent for the Muslims to hear from them the defence against the heresy of which they were accused. They came in a body headed by Jafar bin Abu Talib. None of the Muslims prostrated himself before the king; but saluted him in their usual manner, 'peace be on you'. The king was not offended, rather admiring their manners, repeated the charges brought against them by the embassy of Quraysh. Jafar, who was . a man of noble mien, pre-possessing countenance and persuasive eloquence, stood forth and expounded the doctrines of Islam with zeal and enthusiasm. The king who was a Nestorian Christian found the doctrines similar to those of his own religion, opposed to polytheism. He asked Jafar to recite some passages from the revelations to the Holy Prophet. Jafar recited the surah of Maryam, which- touched the heart of the king so much that he could not help shedding tears. (Tabari; Ibn Athir, Ibn Hisham). It is reported that on this occasion these verses (83 to 86) were revealed. Then Negus, pleased to hear Jafar explaining the religion of Allah, dismissed the embassy of Quraysh from his court returning their gifts, and received the Muslims into his favour over and above the protection they already enjoyed. The Muslims lived in Abyssinia till the Holy Prophet established the community of his followers in Madina. In the meantime Negus and his courtiers had embraced Islam. The Holy Prophet wrote him to send back the party of Muslims to Madina. While the Holy Prophet was at Khaybar, Jafar reached Khaybar on the day of its conquest by his brother, Ali ibn abu Talib. The Holy Prophet was much pleased to welcome back his cousin after so long a separation, and joyfully explained that he did not know which of the two incidents Jafar's arrival or the conquest of Khaybar by Ali-delighted him most.\nAlongwith Jafar came some selected scholars from Abyssinia to learn more about Islam. A group of Christians from Syria headed by the great Christian monk, Buhayra, also came to meet the Holy Prophet. When the Holy Prophet recited the surah Ya Sin before them, their eyes brimmed over with tears and all of them became Muslims.\n"

Verse 93 of this surah, verse 2 of Ta Ha and verse 1 of Tahrim also discourage asceticism.

The worship of Maryam, though repudiated by the protestants, was widely spread among the earlier churches, both in the east and the west. Isa further acknowledges that he was mortal, and that his knowledge was limited like that of a mortal, and that Allah alone is the owner of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them, and that Allah is the almighty, the knowing and the wise. Please refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 255; Ali Imran: 2 and 3 to know pure unity of Allah and how the ideas of son of God and trinity were introduced by the writers of the New Testament. The perversion of true faith took place after the departure of Isa. For Isa's true preaching see commentary of verses 72 to 74 of this surah; and for tawaffaytani (you took me up) see commentary of Ali Imran: 55.\nTHE TAWRAT AND THE INJIL\nThe Tawrat and the Injil are frequently referred to in the Quran. It is well to have clear ideas about these two revealed books.\nTHE TAWRAT\nThe Tawrat is mentioned with honour as having been, in its purity, a true revelation from Allah. To translate it by the words \"The Old Testament\" is obviously wrong. The \"Old Testament\" is a Christian term, applied to a body of old Jewish records. The Protestants and the Roman Catholics are not agreed precisely as to the number of records to be included in the canon of the Old Testament. They use the term in contradiction to the \"New Testament\" whose composition shall be discussed in \"The Injil\". Nor is it correct to translate Tawrat as the \"Pentateuch\", a Greek term meaning the \"five books\", known as Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. A great part of the Jewish law is embodied in these books, which are traditionally ascribed to Musa, but it is certain that they were not written by Musa or in any age contemporary with Musa or within an appreciable distance of time from Musa. They were probably compiled sometime after the return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity. Some new books such as Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi were admittedly written after the return from captivity. The statement in 2 Esdras (about the first century A.D.) that the law was burnt and Ezra (about 458-457 B.C.) was inspired to rewrite it, is probably true as to the historical fact that what is available now is no earlier than the time of Ezra, and some of it a good deal later.\nThe Jews divide their scripture into three parts: (1) the law (Torah), (2) the prophets (Nebiim), and (3) the writings (Kethubim). The corresponding Arabic words are (1) Tawrat, (2) Nabiyin, (3) Kutub. In Luke 24: 44 Jesus refers to the law and the prophets and psalms. In the Old Testament (2 Chronicles 34: 30), the reference to the \"book of the covenant\" must be to the Torah or the original law. The Quran frequently refers to the covenant with reference to the Jews. The modern Christian terms \"Old Testament\" and \"New Testament\" are substitutes for the older terms\" \"Old Covenant and \"New Covenant\". The Samaritans, who claim to be the real children of Israel and disavow the Jews as schismatics, only recognise the Pentateuch, their version is slightly different from The Old Testament.\nIn view of the school of higher criticism, two versions of sacred history existed, different in language, style and spirit, and they were combined together into a narrative in the reign of Hezekiah (B.C. 727-697). This forms the greater part of the Pentateuch as it exists today. In the reign of Josiah about 622 B.C., certain priests and scribes (with Jeremiah) promulgated a new code, pretending that they had found it in the temple (11 Kings 22: 8). This law (Torah) was the basis of Judaism, the new religion then founded in Palestine.\nThe primitive Torah must have been in old Hebrew, but there is no Hebrew manuscript of the Old Testament which can be dated with certainty earlier than 916 A.D. For historical purposes the Creek version, known as the Septuagint, and the Latin version, known as the Vulgate, were the most important versions. Therefore there is no standard text of the Old Testament in its Hebrew form. The Pentateuch includes the laws and regulations associated with the name of Musa, but probably compiled and edited by Ezra or Esdras (Uzayr) in the 5th century B.C.\nIn its original form \"The Law\" (Tawrat) was promulgated by Musa, and is recognised in Islam as having been a revealed book; but it was distorted or lost before Islam was preached. What passed as \"The Law\" with the Jews in the Holy Prophet's time was a mass of traditional writing, as explained above.\nTHE INJIL\nJust as the Tawrat is not the Old Testament, or the Pentateuch, so the Injil, mentioned in the Quran, is certainly not the New Testament, and it is not the four gospels as now received by the Christian church, but an original Gospel which was promulgated by Isa, as Tawrat was promulgated by Musa, and the Quran by the Holy Prophet.\nThe New Testament as now received consists of (a) four gospels with varying contents (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John); and other miscellaneous matter; viz.; (b) The Act of the Apostles (probably written by Luke and purporting to describe the progress of the Christian church under St. Peter and St. Paul from the supposed crucifixion of Jesus to about 61 A.D.); (c) twenty-one letters or epistles (the majority written by St. Paul to various churches or individuals, but a few written by other disciples, and of a general nature); and (d) the book of revelation or Apocalypse (ascribed to St. John, and containing mystic visions and prophecies, of which it is difficult to understand the meanings).\nAs Prof. F C. Burkitt remarks in the (Canon of the New Testament) it is an odd miscellany. \"The four biographies of Jesus Christ are not all independent of each other, and neither of them was intended by its writer to form one of a quartet. But they are all put side by side, unharmonised, one of them being actually imperfect at the end, and one being only the first volume of a large work.\" All this body of unmethodical literature was casual in its nature. No wonder, because the early Christians expected the end of the world very soon. The four canonical gospels were only four out of many, and some others besides the four have survived. Each writer just wrote down some odd sayings of the master that he recollected. Among the miracles described there is only one which is described in all the four gospels, and others were described and believed in, in other gospels which are not mentioned in any of the four canonical gospels. Some of the epistles contain expositions of doctrine, but this has been interpreted differently by different Churches. There must have been hundreds of such epistles, and not all the epistles now received as canonical were always so received or intended to be so received. The Apocalypse also was not the only one in the field. There were others. They were prophecies of \"things which must shortly come to pass\"; they could not have been meant for long preservation, \"for the time is at hand\".\nWhen were these four gospels written? By the end of the second century A.D. they were in existence, but it does not follow that they had been selected by that date to form a canon. They were merely pious productions comparable to Dean Farrar's Life of Christ. There were other gospels besides. And further, the writers of two of them, Mark and Luke, were not among the twelve disciples \"called\" by Jesus. About the gospel of St. John there is much controversy as to authorship, date, and even as to whether it was all written by one person. Clement of Rome (about 97 A.D.) and Polycarp (about 112 A.D.) quote sayings of Jesus in a form different from those found in the present canonical gospels. Polycarp (Epistle, vii) inveighs much against men \"who prevent the sayings of the Lord to their own lusts,\" and he wants to turn \"to the word handed down to us from the beginning,\" thus referring to a book (or a tradition) much earlier than the four orthodox gospels. An epistle of St Barnabas and an Apoclaypse of St. Peter were recognised by Presbyter Clement of Alexandria (flourished about 180 A.D.). The Apoclaypse of St. John, which is a part of the present canon in the west, forms no part of the Peshitta (Syriac) version of the eastern Christians, which was produced about 411-433 A.D. and which was used by the Nestorian Christians. It is probable that Peshitta was the version (or an Arabic form of it) used by the Christians in Arabia in the time of the Holy Prophet. The final form of the New Testament canon for the west was fixed in the fourth century A.D. (say, about 367 A.D.) by Athanasius and the Nicene creed. The beautiful Codex Sinaiticus which was acquired for the British Museum in 1934, and is one of the earliest complete manuscripts of the Bible, may be dated about the fourth century. It is written in the Greek language. Fragments of unknown gospels have also been discovered, which do not agree with the received canonical gospels.\nThe Injil (Creek, Evangel = Gospel) spoken of by the Quran is not the New Testament. It is not the four gospels now received as canonical. It is the single Gospel which, Islam teaches, was revealed to Jesus (Isa) and which he taught. Fragments of it survive in the received canonical gospels and in some others, of which traces survive (e.g. the gospel of childhood or the nativity, the gospel of St. Barnabas, etc.). Muslims therefore do not accept the present Bible (New Testament and Old Testament), as \"the Injil\", but as it contains some portions of \"the Injil\" revealed to Isa it is paid due respect, yet they reject the peculiar doctrines taught by orthodox Christianity or Judaism. They claim to be in the true tradition of Ibrahim and therefore all that is of value in the older revelations, it is claimed, is incorporated in the teaching of the last of the prophets.\n"

The Christians address their priests as father, and in the same sense they refer to God as the father in heaven. Many traditions say that the real father of Ibrahim died before his birth and he was brought up by Azar, his uncle, who was the patriarch of his family. It is also said that Azar, his uncle, married his mother after his father's death, therefore Azar was also his step-father. The Holy Prophet's claim that impurity of ignorance and infidelity never touched any of his ancestors from Adam to Abdullah also confirms the abovenoted fact. The word ab may mean an uncle or an ancestor as Ismail, the uncle of Yaqub, has been addressed as ab in verse 133 of al Baqarah. According to Genesis 11 : 27 the name of Ibrahim's father was Terah. In the Talmud his name is Therach. In verse 41 of Ibrahim, Ibrahim prays for his parents along with the other believers which shows that his father was a believer, otherwise a prophet of Allah could never have associated an infidel with believers and prayed to cover him with Allah's mercy. Azar was his uncle or the brother of his grandfather.\nIbrahim lived among the Chaldeans, who had great knowledge of the stars and heavenly bodies. The Babylonian religion was an admixture of animism and nature worship. The two powers most commonly chosen were the sun and the moon. Allah showed him the spiritual glories behind the magnificent powers and laws of the physical universe. When he saw the waning of the stars, the moon and the sun, he saw through the folly of idol-worship and the futility of worshipping distant beautiful things that shine, to which the ignorant ascribe a power which is not in them. They rise and set according to laws whose author is Allah. Its worship is therefore futile. Appearances are deceptive. That is not God. It is a folly to worship created things and beings when the author and the creator is there. All must turn to the true God, renounce all these follies, and proclaim one true Allah.\nIbrahim was free from superstitious fears, for he had found the true God, without whose will nothing can happen. He admonished his people to come in the security of faith instead of wandering in the wilderness of fear by worshipping the \"setting ones\" creatures created by Him.\nThose who believe and do not intermix belief with iniquity (zulm) are the rightly guided. In view of this Quranic condition the position of those companions, who deserted the Holy Prophet in battlefields, now and then, doubted his integrity and judgement, becomes dubious.\nThe spiritual education of Ibrahim (given to him by Allah) enabled him to preach the truth among his people.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nZulm means (any) evil or transgression in thought or action. In their supplications, the prophets and the Imams have used the word zalim for themselves in order to describe their humble position before Allah at the time of seeking His mercy (refer to Anbiya : 87) because all created beings, be they prophets or Imams, need His mercy at all times in their lives here and hereafter. They have used it to avoid vanity or pride so that through utmost humility they could become thoroughly devoted to the service of Allah. Such a confession is a part of the tasbih (glorification of Allah) they used to recite again and again, sitting, standing, walking or reclining.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"We do not know Thee, O Lord, as Thou should be known, nor do we worship Thee as Thou should be worshipped.\"\n"

A sign is the manifestation of Allah's will. There is nothing in the universe which does not point to the eternal and self-subsisting (hayy al qayyum) existence of Allah, therefore, whatever there is in the universe is a sign of Allah, but all signs are not alike in their manifestation of the original cause. Some are direct and clear. Others are vague and unclear. For example, there are many things which a man uses in his day-to-day life. It is very difficult for another man who has not seen the user of these things to positively describe him by looking at his clothes etcetera used by him when they are separated from him, but if one sees his portrait or image he is at once identified. As the attributes and the glory of the Lord are manifested to their possible perfection only in His messengers and His chosen representatives, they are His direct, clear and perfect signs. The foremost among them are the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt.\nThe verses of the Quran, the miracles displayed by Allah's chosen representatives and all the divine commandments and decrees are also the signs of Allah.\n"

Through this verse Allah has made clear to them that nothing of this sort would happen, but certainly the angel of death will come and the day of final judgement will come when belief in them will not do any good to the disbelievers, who had not believed in them before. Please refer to the commentary of al Baqarah : 255 to have a clear understanding of the words in the Quran or in the traditions which refer to the movement or visibility of Allah.

All the aspects of living with reference to self, family, relatives and possessions should be employed in the service of Allah, out of His love, if one completely surrenders oneself to the will of Allah. There was no better or greater manifestation of a perfect submission to Allah than the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt. They were divinely commissioned to establish themselves as everlasting ideals or models for mankind till the day of judgement. An all-comprehensive manifestation of such a perfect submission was seen in Karbala, where the grandson of the Holy Prophet, Imam Husayn, had sacrificed all that he had in the way of Allah. The Bible informs us that Isa said on the cross: \"O my Lord! Why Thou has forsaken me?\" Ibrahim covered his eyes before going to slaughter his son.\nImam Husayn, every pour of his body a bleeding wound, slid over the burning sand of Naynawa from his horse at the time of Asr prayers, rested his forehead on the ground in prostration and said:\n\"O Merciful Lord of the worlds! Husayn, Your servant, has given You everything he had received from You, in Your way.\nAccept the humble sacrifice of your servant.\nIf the grandson of your messenger had more, he would have given it to you willingly.\nO my Lord! Be merciful and oft-forgiving to the faithfuls.\"\nThere was no despair,. no remorse, no sense of loss in his last words. He did not ask anything for himself. He only remembered the faithfuls and asked forgiveness for them. He is an ideal who every refined, high-minded and virtuous person follows and glorifies.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 6:164]\nAfter the emphatic denunciations of idolatry there remains no alternative but to say: \"There is no god save Allah, the Lord of the worlds\". The doctrine of personal responsibility is decisive. We ourselves are responsible for our deeds. We cannot transfer the consequences to someone else. Nor can any one vicariously atone for our sins. The idea of redemption renders Allah helpless against the evil done freely in His kingdom. Because of this conception the evil-doers run scot-free, without fear of punishment, and destroy peace, harmony and rule of law in the world .\nIn Islam every individual is answerable for his faith and deeds when he returns to Allah on the day of reckoning. The faithful who have done good and followed the teachings of Allah and his Prophet shall be rewarded and the disbelievers and the sinners will be punished. Those believers who made mistakes but sincerely repented and amended their conduct shall receive His mercy and forgiveness. This system of accountability creates a viable discipline in the human society.\nThe tradition attributed to the Holy Prophet that the dead will be punished if his friends and relatives weep and mourn over his death is disapproved by this verse.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Christians have a misconceived idea that the intercessor bears the burden of the sins of the person whom he has saved from punishment. They also say that all the prophets were sinners except Isa who alone will bear the sins of the sinners. But intercession does not mean bearing the burden of the sinner, therefore, all the prophets are able to intercede on behalf of the sinners for obtaining Allah's forgiveness, because no prophet had ever committed a sin.\n"

The verse clearly says that Allah has raised some of His deputies over others in ranks, on account of their wisdom, piety and total dedication to the cause of Allah (jihad); therefore they should be allowed to exercise the divinely delegated authority, followed and obeyed."

The Holy Prophet (see commentary of an Nisa: 41) will be a witness over all the witnesses, which means he was present in the times of all the prophets.

In addition to all the material things necessary to sustain life, it also refers to all those powers and faculties which help man to rise to a higher plane to prepare for his spiritual destiny, on account of which the angels were asked to prostrate themselves before Adam. Iblis refused to be of those who bowed down, because he arrogantly despised the angels who bowed down as well as man to whom they bowed down. Arrogance, envy and rebellion were his crimes .\nAs said above the spiritual destiny of man put him above the angels and jinn, so the refusal of Shaytan (Iblis) to accept man's superiority was unreasonable. It was egotism which prompted him to impertinent rebellion.\nAllah created man with His own hands from clay and gave him His own spirit (ruh)). The essential quality of clay is softness which makes it adaptable to any form or shape-obedience and submission, and total submission to Allah's will is Islam-the spiritual destiny of man. So Shaytan, a product of fire, not having the qualities of adaptability, nor blessed with the holy spirit, was the first creature of Allah who resorted to conjecture, therefore was thrown out, eternally accursed. On his request Allah gave him respite (by saying): Be you among those who have respite. It implies that there are others, like him, under respite.\nShaytan has a large army of wicked seducers, and those who are their associates, helpers and deputies. The assault of Shaytan's evil is from all sides, and as said in verse 17; most men are led astray by him, while verse 18 says that Allah will fill hell with all of them.\nFor verses 19 to 25 see commentary of al Baqarah: 21 to 38.\n"

The people of Thamud are known as the tribe of second Ad who lived in Ahqaf, from Umman to Hadhramawt (Ahqaf: 21). Their prophet and warner was Salih. Their territory included both rocky country and fertile valley of Qura, and the crisis in their history is connected with a wonderful she-camel. They were also, like the tribe of Ad, godless and idol worshippers. They used to worship a part of a mountain and offer sacrifices on it. There was scarcity of water and the arrogant privileged classes tried to prevent the access of the poor or their cattle to the springs, while Salih used to intervene on their behalf (Shu-ara: 155 and Qamar: 28), also they tried to monopolise the pasture, a free gift of Allah as per verse 73 of this surah. This particular she-camel was made a test case (Qamar: 27) to see if the arrogant people would see light and come to reason. On their demand Salih, with the pemmission of Allah, made a she-camel come out from the mountain with a baby camel. It was decided that one day the she-camel would drink water from the spring and on the next day the people would take it. The she-camel, after drinking the water, gave as much milk as the whole town could drink, but in spite of Salih's warning that the she-camel was a sign of Allah and if they let her come to any harm, they would be seized with a grievous punishment, they hamstrung her, and insolently defied the order of their Lord. Consequently they were destroyed by a dreadful earthquake, which threw them on the ground and buried them with their houses and their buildings. Salih was saved by Allah's mercy. There was no survivor. His speech is a warning as well as a reference to the sin and folly of the people who belie the signs of Allah in any time.\nThalabi writes in his Tafsir that the Holy Prophet said to Ali:\n\"The worst of men in the days gone by were those who killed the she camel of Salih. The worst men among the present generation are those who will slay you.\"\nThalabi says that the name of the killer of the she camel was Qaddar and his mother's name was Quttama. So also Qaddar was the name of Ibn Muljim and Quttama was his mother's name .\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn verse 74 it is said that the people of Thamud had hewed the mountains to make houses, which shows that they were a nation of architects, well versed in the art of masonry. They also built palaces in the plains as their abodes but used the houses in the mountains after nightfall to protect themselves, and also kept there those among them who were about to die. Professor Nicholson says that according to the monuments found in Madayan al Salih in the mountain-houses the people of Thamud buried their dead. It does not disprove the Quran. Obviously when the sick died they must have been buried there.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 7:80]\nLut was a cousin of Ibrahim, his maternal aunt's son. Lut's own sister, Sara, was the first wife of Ibrahim. He was sent as a prophet to the people of Mutafikat, a complex of five towns, Sodom being the largest. He was not one of them but looked upon them as his brethren (Qaf: 13). He was a messenger of Allah, and was therefore free from the shameful features attributed to him in Genesis 19: 30 to 38. The people of Mutafikat were wicked and extremely niggardly. The road connecting Egypt with Syria went through their towns. Those who travelled on this road had to break journey and stay in their towns which they did not like. It is reported that one day Shaytan came to them as a male human being and taught them homo-sexuality in order to stop the travellers from taking shelter with them. From then on they became so addicted to this unnatural wickedness that the word sodomy now literally means male homo-sexuality. They turned a deaf ear to all the warnings given by Lut. Then angel Jibra-il along with some other angels visited Ibrahim and told him that they were going to Sodom to carry out Allah's command. When they entered the town in human form, Lut was watering the fields. He warned them to be on guard against the wickedness of the people and took them to his own house. The wife of Lut was in league with the people and as their agent at once informed them that Lut had brought some travellers as guests. They surrounded Lut's house and shouted at him to deliver the guests to them. Jibra-il made them blind and asked Lut to leave the place along with those who believed. After their departure Allah rained down on them a shower of stones. Everything was buried under the mountain of stones. Nothing was left, no trace of anything could ever be found. According to verse 84 they were criminals.\nOnce a slave, charged with the murder of his master, was brought to Imam Ali. The slave told him that his master copulated with him by force at midnight when they were alone in the house, therefore, he killed him. When asked by Imam Ali the slave said that his master neither repented nor asked pardon of Allah when he struck him. It was the Holy Prophet who had told him that: \"The dead body of a sodomist who had not repented before death is removed from his grave and thrown into the heap of the sodomists of Sodom so that they all shall be raised together on the day of judgement.\" Accordingly when the grave of the slain master was opened it was found empty. The slave was set free. Then the people came to know that the jurisdiction of Ali's authority was equally applicable over the dead and the alive.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nFor the first time sodomy is declared a crime, a most horrible crime; and capital punishment has been ordained. Refer to fiqh.\n"

The land Midian takes its name from him.\nShu-ayb, a descendant of Ibrahim, was sent as a prophet by Allah to guide the people of Midian and A-ikah.\nGiving short measure or weight, depriving people of rightful dues, creating mischief and disorder, taking to highway robbery, cutting off people from access to the worship of Allah and abusing and exploiting religion itself for their crooked ends, were some of their sins which Shu-ayb wanted to eradicate. The gentle and persuasive arguments of Shu-ayb fell on hard hearts.\nThe fate of Midian people was the same as that of the people of Thamud. A shower of ashes and cinders accompanying a volcanic eruption seized them, and then an earthquake by night buried all of them in their own homes.\nThe miraculous staff, which Musa had, is reported to have been given to him by Shu-ayb. Another miracle associated with him was that whenever he wanted to climb a mountain to reach its peak, it used to lower itself for him.\n"

Allah gave enough rope to the people, but neither affluence nor suffering taught them patience, humility, gratitude and kindness to others because they belied the signs of Allah and rejected belief and guidance preached to them by the messengers of Allah. They thought such things happened in all ages, but they were found napping and helpless when wrath of Allah seized them in the midst of their obstinate infidelity. The prophets who were rejected by their own people stood firm on Allah's message, and were able to convince a few to believe in Allah and His message. Those who had heard the message and rejected it found it more difficult to retrace their steps. Evil had blocked the channels of Allah's grace to them. With each step they fell deeper and deeper into the mire.\nIt must be noted that while all the prophets, having tried their best to reform their people, left them to their fate when nothing positive could be done, but the Holy Prophet, as the \"mercy unto the worlds\", notwithstanding a more adamant and clever opposition, always felt deeply concerned about the human race. \"You may perhaps wear out your heart because they do not come to belief\" says Allah to him in ash-Shu-ara: 3.\nAs said in al Baqarah: 7 (see its commentary) Allah seals up the hearts of those who do not believe.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 7:103]\n\"The Moses of Quran is a Muhammad in disguise\" is an interesting comment of a Christian scholar. There is an instructive parallelism in Musa's mission to Muhammad's mission.\nThe Quran never mentions the Egyptian king or kings by name. It uses the general designation, viz., Firawn, a dynastic title.\nDuring the time of prophet Yusuf the children of Israil prospered in Egypt, but times changed and the Egyptians treated them as their slaves. Musa was raised up as one who had been brought up among themselves to preach unity of Allah to them and to unite and reclaim his own people, rescue them and lead them to a new life. Astrologers had informed Firawn that a boy would be born among the children of Israel who would put an end to his life. Firawn issued orders to all midwives to kill the male babies born to the Israelites but spare the female babies. When Musa was born the attending midwife was overawed by the light radiating from his face and advised his mother to hide him. She reported to the king that a dead girl was born and buried.\nAllah revealed to his mother.\n\"Suckle him. If you are afraid for him, cast him in the river without any fear or regret, for We shall restore him to you, and make him a prophet. (Qasas: 7) Put him in a wooden box and cast it in the river. The river will cast it on the bank. An enemy of Ours, and his, will retrieive it.\" (Ta Ha: 39)\nThe mother of Musa did as was directed. Then he was picked up by the family of Firawn unaware that he was. the boy who would destroy them. Asiya, the wife of Firawn, requested Firawn not to kill him and let her adopt him as a son. Musa refused the wet nurse appointed by them. Through his sister his mother was appointed as his nurse. So Musa grew up in the palace of Firawn. Refer to the following verses to know more about Musa- Baqarah: 49 to 71 ; Nisa: 153; Ma-idah: 20 to 26; Yunus: 75 to 92; Hud: 96 to 99; Bani Israil: 101 to 104; Kahf: 60 to 82; Maryam: 51 to 53; Ta Ha: 9 to 98; Muminun: 45 to 49; Shu-ara: 10 to 68; Naml: 7 to 14; Qasas: 7 to 48; Saffat: 114 to 122; Mumin: 23 to 55; Zukhraf: 46 to 56; Ahqaf: 12; Dhariyat: 38 to 40; Saf: 5; Nazi-at: 15 to 26.\nWhen Musa came before Firawn to tell him that he was a prophet from the Lord of the worlds, Firawn was sitting in his court with his ministers and chiefs around him relying upon their own superior worldly power aided by the magic which was a part of the Egyptian religion. Confronting them stood two men, Musa with his mission from Allah, and his brother Harun who was his lieutenant (note the instructive parallelism between \"Musa and Harun\" and \"Muhammad and Ali\"-\"Ali is to me as Harun was to Musa save that prophethood terminated with me\", said the Holy Prophet) .\n\"I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds\", Musa introduced himself to Firawn and said: \"Let the people of Israil go with me; because I have come with a clear sign.\" Firawn asked Musa to display the sign. Musa threw down his staff and it became a live serpent. He also drew forth his hand from his garment, it was shining bright and white. (See Exodus 4: 1 to 8). These miracles were displayed to prove that Egyptian magic was nothing before the true power of Allah. In Islam the \"white hand\" of Musa has passed into a proverb, for a symbol of divine glory dazzling to the beholders. Although the Egyptians were impressed by the two signs but they thought that Musa was a clever magician, so, on the advice of his courtiers Firawn summoned the best magicians of Egypt. They cast their spell first. The ropes they threw on the floor turned into swirling snakes. Their trickery made a great impression on the people. Then Musa threw down his staff, it swallowed up their conjurations in no time. The falsehood was exposed and the truth was confirmed. Vanquished and humiliated the magicians fell down prostrate in adoration and said, \"We believe in the Lord of the worlds, the Lord of Musa and Harun.\" Firawn was furious. He threatened them with severe punishment. They answered: \"We have (in any case) to go back to our Lord.\" The same reply the faithful companions of Imam Husayn gave in Karbala. Along with the magicians a large number of Egyptians also came into the fold of true faith. Firawn arrested all of them and kept them in captivity. Musa and his followers camped outside the city. Allah afflicted the people of Firawn with famine and dearth of everything that they might take heed, but they did not believe. Then Allah let loose on them floods and locusts and vermin, but they were a people full of sin (see Exodus 7: 19, 20; and 8: 2 to 6 and 16 to 17 and 21 to 24; and 9: 3 to 6, and 9 to 11, and 22 to 24; and 10: 12 to 14 and 22; and 12: 29). Then Musa and his followers crossed the Red Sea, while Firawn's host which came in pursuit was drowned. See commentary of al Baqarah: 50. After crossing the Red Sea they were in Sinai peninsula. There they met the people who were idolworshippers. The Israelites were at once attracted by their idols, and asked Musa to make them also an idol like theirs. See Exodus 32 : 1. When Allah had exalted them over all the nations of the world, why did they want to seek a god other than Allah? Because idolatry is a national characteristic of the Jews.\nFor verse 141 see commentary of al Baqarah: 49; and for verse 142 see commentary of al Baqarah: 51, wherein the similarity between \"Musa and Harun\" and \"Muhammad and Ali\" has been made clear.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe importance of the number 40 (days, nights, weeks, months or years) for spiritual attainments has been confirmed by many authentic traditions.\nThe desire of Musa to see Allah was not because he was unsure but like Ibrahim (al Baqarah: 260) he wanted to witness the glory of Allah. Also his companions wanted to see Allah (see al Baqarah: 55). Musa could not withstand the manifestation of the divine glory, because it was reserved for the Holy Prophet about whose advent Musa and Isa had made clear announcement, in advance. See commentary of al Baqarah: 40.\nPlease refer to An-am: 104 according to which no one can see Allah, neither in this world nor in the hereafter. Lan in verse 143 means \"never\". Musa turned repentant to Allah and declared his firm belief in Him. \"First\" means not the first in time, but most firm in faith. Only finite beings or things which can be arrested by vision are seen and Allah is an infinite being. So to say that Allah can be visible is an ignorant conjecture, put forward by those who do not believe in the absoluteness of His existence.\nImam Ali said:\nO He! O He whom none knows what He is, nor how He is, nor where He is, nor in what respect He is, but He.\nAllah chose Musa, above other men and gave him the Tawrat, with instructions to warn his followers that if they rejected the word of Allah, calamities would seize them as in the case of ancient Egyptians, the Ad and the Thamud.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nManifestation in verse 143 does not mean taking form or appearance. In Najm: 18 it is stated that the Holy Prophet witnessed much greater signs (manifestations) of Allah. Allah's absolute infiniteness makes it impossible to attribute corporeality to Him, but it is possible to have spiritual awareness of His being through the faculties developed by devoted concentration of heart and mind-the \"meeting with the Lord\" in An-am: 155 and Ha Mim: 54 must be understood in this sense.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 7:172]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nSome commentators refer to mithaq ul alast-that after the creation of Adam Allah brought forth from the loins of Adam all his descendants (all humanity, born or unborn, without any limit of time), conscious of their existence, on the earth or in some state before coming on earth, and that a covenant about His rububiyat was taken from all of them, which is binding on each individual. Some Shia commentators say that the covenant also included the finality of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet and imamat of Ali ibn abi Talib. It is also said that some accepted and some rejected the covenant. Those who accepted it there accept it here also, and those who rejected it there reject it here also. The theory of a covenant taken in the state of pre-existence is found unreasonable in view of the following facts:\n(1) The words in the text refer to the descendants (dhurriyyatahum) of the children of Adam, who were brought forth from their loins, not from the loins of Adam.\n(2) The question \"Am I not your Lord?\" was addressed to all. All of them said \"yes\". It was a unanimous reply. There was no difference of opinion.\n(3) Allah made each of them witness over himself so that no one may say: \"I was not aware (conscious) of this,\" or that, having no choice of his or her own, blindly followed the ancestors. If this refers to the state of pre-existence nobody would remember it, nor the reminders or warnings of any prophet would help to recall as to what took place prior to existence, therefore, on the day of reckoning every person will say: \"I do not remember.\"\n(4) It suggests compulsion, whereas man has free choice to believe or not to believe.\nThe true meaning of the verse is that Allah brings forth from every human being his offspring and makes each one aware of one's self or soul when one reaches maturity; and at that stage of full consciousness he knows that there is a (supreme and uncaused) creator who has brought him into existence. This acknowledgement is the result of an inherent awareness in every human being, which makes him responsible for his belief or disbelief, his good deeds or evil deeds. At this stage each individual becomes free from the blind influence of others.\nThis verse does not refer to any state of development prior to the state when every man becomes a witness over himself.\nTo presume the existence of the cognitive self (I) prior to the present life, is to accept the possibility of the transmigration of the soul from one body to another body-a doctrine rejected by Islam on the basis of theological and rational arguments. There are stages through which the human soul passes till it reaches full consciousness, but there is no possibility of the existence of any conscious stage, prior to the present consciousness, which cannot be remembered. All that has been said in this connection about the existence of cognitive self in the state of pre-existence is based upon conjecture relied upon by the old pagan cults to believe in the false theories of transmigration. Sayyid Murtada, Shaykh Mufid and Abul Ali Tabrasi have rejected the possibility of a conscious life in any state of pre existence.\nAlso refer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 81. Another interpretation of this verse is as under:\nAllah, the omnipotent creator, after creating Adam from clay, asked him and every soul to be born in his progeny, who, in the infinite knowledge of the almighty Allah, would come on this earth: \"Am I not your Lord?\" All of them said: \"Yes. We bear witness\". It was done so that men may not say that they did not know who their Lord-Creator is. This applies to verse 173 also. The Holy Prophet said that if only men knew when Ali was appointed mawla and amir al muminin, they would not deny his superiority over all other created beings. According to Firdaws al Akhyar by Dayami, chap. 14, p. 274; and Tafsir of al Ayyashi, when the almighty Lord decided to create the universe, He assembled all His creatures together before Himself and asked them: \"Who is your Lord?\" Thereupon the first to answer was the Holy Prophet, and next was Ali ibna abi Talib, and then all the Imams who were to be his descendants. They all said: \"You are our Lord.\" Then the almighty Lord made them the repositories of divine knowledge and said to the angels: \"Behold, these are the repositories of My knowledge and these are the trusted ones from among all My creatures and they shall be the guides of all in everything.\"\nThen the Lord commanded all the descendants of Adam to acknowledge Him as their Lord and to promise obedience to them, and all said: \"We promise.\" The angels also said: \"We bear witness\".\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 7:175]\nIt is said that \"The news of the man whom We gave Our signs\" refers to Balam, in the days of Firawn, who knew the ism al azam. Firawn asked him to pray for Musa's arrest. He agreed and sat on his donkey to go to a particular place to recite the ism al azam for Musa's arrest, but the donkey did not budge. He beat the animal to its death. Then he realised that he had totally forgotten the ism al azam. He died as an infidel.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nSome commentators think the narrative relates to Balam. Some think the person referred here is Umayya ibn Abu Salt who read the old scriptures and knew that Allah would send a prophet about that time, but when the promised prophet, the Holy Prophet did arrive, he refused to acknowledge him. Some think it relates to Amru ibn Numan ibn Sayfi, an ascetic, who believed in the creed of Ibrahim but mixed it with the false beliefs of Christian monks, and when he was censured by the Holy Prophet, he turned against him.\nImam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir said: \"Though it relates to Balam, but Allah intends to set an example for those who receive true guidance from Allah, yet prefer to act according to their own desires in order to lay hands on the worldly gains.\"\nEarthly desires eventually bring man low to the level of beasts and even worse. If he follows the guidance he receives from Allah he is blessed with exalted spiritual honour. He who rejects Allah and His guidance is like a dog who lolls out his tongue, whether he is attacked and pursued, or left alone. It is part of his nature to slobber and be contemptible. Imam Ali has compared such men to a restive she camel who shows unwillingness to tackle when her rider draws rein, and goes aimlessly in any direction, and stumbles when he applies no check to her.\n"

See Nazi-at 42 to 44. \"To your Lord is the end of it\" says verse 44 of an Nazi-at.\nThe word sa-at refers to the end of the creatures' striving unto their destiny. The destiny is fixed. It may be individual or collective. There are many grades also. It is a relative term applicable to resurrection or destiny of an individual, or a community or any part of the universe. Many worlds have been created and reached their destinies and experienced their resurrections. There are many worlds which are in the early stages of becoming, and many are drawing to their end. So no finite being knows the hour of termination. Allah is the end, unto Him everything is journeying and to Him everything shall return. He is free and independent of the application of time and space, because they are finite, applicable only to dimensional beings.

The Holy Prophet learnt that a caravan of the Quraysh laden with merchandise, under Abu Sufyan, was coming from Syria. Abu Sufyan sent a message to Abu Jahl that the Muslims were planning to attack his caravan in order to seize the merchandise he was bringing from Syria. The Holy Prophet, as guided by Allah, decided to leave the caravan and march out boldly against the well-armed and well equipped Quraysh army coming from Makka under the command of Abu Jahl in order to destroy the Muslims in Madina, even though some of the very close companions opposed this policy. There was a party which was not wholeheartedly submissive to the divine order, but Sad bin Ma-adh and Miqdad said: \"We will do as the Holy Prophet commands.\" The Quraysh army, full of zeal and fury, advanced to annihilate from the face of the earth the meagre band of 313 ill-fed and poorly equipped Muslims. The Holy Prophet met the advancing army of Quraysh at Badr situated at a three day's journey from Madina.\nThose who were averse to fighting were not convinced that it was a wise or prudent decision, therefore, they felt as if they were being driven to death while death was staring them in the face. They were frightened and perturbed. It was the first trial Muslims were put to in order to prove their faith in the truth. It was also a clear proof that the Holy Prophet was the true messenger of Allah, because unless it was so he would have not risked total annihilation of the handful of Muslims, certain to take place if Allah had not assured him that they would win the battle. By Allah's help they won a splendid victory and the standard of truth was established, never to be lowered again.\nHamza, Ubaydah and Ali were sent by the Holy Prophet to fight against Utbah, Shaybah and Walid in single combat. Ali and Hamza killed all the three combatants but Ubaydah was seriously wounded and succumbed to his injuries. He is the first martyr. Then the general combat began. Ali and Hamza destroyed the army of Quraysh beyond recovery. They ran away to Makka. See commentary of Ali Imran 123 to 127. While Ali and Hamza were in the battlefield, a large number of the Holy Prophet's companions, acclaimed as the heroes of Islam, after his departure from this world, watched the fighting from a safe distance as unconcerned spectators.\nIn addition to the decision the Holy Prophet took (not to attack the caravan and take possession of the rich booty but to fight against the Quraysh army), the other facts which clearly show that it was the pagans of Makka who took the initiative to attack the Muslims are: the 13 days distance between Makka and Madina-the Muslim travelled 3 days to meet the pagans of Makka at Badr, who had already left Makka 10 days before with full readiness to destroy the Muslims; and the material as well as the mental condition of the Muslims who were so unprepared for such an encounter that they saw nothing but death waiting for them.\n"

(Refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 8 to 20 and 93).\nWhenever the Holy Prophet made known Ali's special relationship with Allah and himself, all his notable companions were present, particularly in Ghadir Khum where he declared: \"Of whomsoever I am mawla Ali is his mawla \" (see commentary of al Ma-idah 67), yet they paid no attention to his last and final call which completed and perfected the religion of Allah, although verse 24 again ordains that the call of Muhammad is the call of Allah. The call of the Holy Prophet invited the people to follow the divinely commissioned Imams among his Ahl ul Bayt who alone were chosen to guide the people unto the right path. It is the duty of every believer to answer the call of the Holy Prophet or any of the Imams of his Ahl ul Bayt to strive in the way of Allah to defend the faith (Jihad).\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nEvery person responds to the call of his desires, but when he submits to the call of Allah or the Holy Prophet his act of submission is due to \"the coming of Allah in between a man and his desires\", and thus he is prevented from going astray on account of the dictates of his vain desires.\nIn verse 25 it is made clear that the consequences of social, political and religious deviation will not only harm those who have done injustice to themselves but also equally jeopardise the well-being of those who have done no wrong, therefore all the believers should safeguard themselves against evil by observing the laws made by Allah.\nOn several occasions the Muslims were put to test and trial (Ahzab: 11). Abu Ayyub Ansari narrates that once the Holy Prophet said to Ammar: \"After me you will encounter many troubles. My followers will kill each other. They will sow the seeds of discord among themselves. In such events adhere to Ali, even if all of my followers form an alliance against him. Follow Ali and leave the people to follow whichsoever way they desire. Ali will not turn you away from the right path shown by me. To obey Ali is to obey me, and to obey me is to obey Allah.\"\nHakim Abul Qasim Asqani says, when this verse was revealed, the Holy Prophet said:\nTo oppose Ali's successorship after me is to deny my prophethood and the prophethood of all the prophets before me.\nAccording to Imam Hasan bin Ali al Mujtaba verse 25 gives report of the battle of Jaml engineered by Talha, Zubayr and A-isha against Ali. Tafsir al Khashshaf says that once Zubayr asked the Holy Prophet as to how much he loved Ali. The Holy Prophet said:\nI love him as no man has ever loved any other man, not even his own son. How evil it will be when you will go to fight against him?\n"

They would leave Madina and go to Syria. The Holy Prophet appointed Sad bin Ma-adh as an arbitrator, but the Jews wanted to consult Abu Lababa who was their old friend and relative, before accepting the arbitration of Sad bin Ma-adh. When they sought Abu Lababa's advice, he pointed his finger to his throat, to indicate that it would be as if cutting their own throats. The Holy Prophet came to know about the treachery of Abu Lababa through Jibra-il. Abu Lababa at once realised what he had done-he had knowingly defrauded Allah and His prophet. Then he tied himself to a pillar of the masjid al nabawiyy and avowed that he would neither drink nor eat until he was forgiven by Allah and His prophet. The Holy Prophet went to him and told him that he had been forgiven.\nAnother narration of treachery had been reported by Jabir bin Abdullah Ansari that when Jibra-il informed the Holy Prophet that Abu Sufyan is secretly planning to attack very soon, the Holy Prophet asked his close companions to make urgent preparation for the expected confrontation. One of the hypocrites wrote a secret letter to Abu Sufyan, informing him about the defensive readiness of the Muslims.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 8:41]\nKHUMS MEANS ONE FIFTH.\nGhanayam means the property, movable and immovable, surrendered by the enemy in any battle. Verse 1 of this surah has already stated that it belongs to Allah and the Holy Prophet. Although the Sunni jurists have restricted its meaning to the spoils of war, but actually, according to Shia scholars, on every profit obtained by trade and labour, or from mines, or from sea or by means mentioned in the books of fiqh, payment of khums is obligatory, because as per the rules of lexicography the word ghanimat applies to all these things. Well-known commentators like Razi and Qartabi admit that the real meaning of ghanimat does not justify its restriction to the spoils of war only. See Tafsir Razi vol. 15, p.164 and Tafsir Qartabi vol. 4, p. 2840. Tafsir al Manar also gives the same verdict.\nAccording to this verse out of every profit, from wherever it comes, including the spoils of wars, khums has to be paid, because both ma (a relative pronoun-mawsulah) and shay are of a general nature and carry no restrictions.\nThe amount of khums payable is divided into six equal parts to be disbursed as under:\n(1) Allah's share.\n(2) The Holy Prophet's share.\n(3) The Holy Prophet's relatives' share.\n(The Holy Prophet used to receive all these three shares).\n(4) Share of the orphans of Bani Hashim.\n(5) Share of the poor.\n(6) Share of the wayfarers.\nAs sadqa has been forbidden for the relatives of the Holy Prophet, Allah has decreed khums for them.\nIn the present age the total amount of khums is divided into two equal parts and disbursed as under:\n(1) Sahm al Sadat-the share of the descendants of the Holy Prophet.\n(2) Sahm al Imam-the share of the Imam, which is given to the mujtahid the payer of khums follows, or can be distributed or utilised by his permission. The mujtahid uses it for the good of the faithful and for the propagation of the faith. For details refer to fiqh.\nVerse 26 of Bani Israil says: \"Give the kinsman his due\". They are Fatimah and her children, the Ahl ul Bayt, according to Tafsir Durr al Manthur, vol. 4, p. 177. Unless and until a Muslim sets aside the khums he cannot be deemed to have paid his dues. Tafsir Ruh al Ma-ani, vol.3, p.637; Tafsir Naysaburi, vol. 3, p . 215, and other commentaries mention that khums is for Allah and for the messenger and for his kinsmen. They are the people to whom the abandoned wealth belongs, about which Allah has revealed in the Quran:\nThat which Allah gives as wealth unto His messenger from the people of the towns, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin, (Hashr: 7)\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Recognise the rights of my pious and upright relatives for the sake of Allah, and as for those among my kinsmen who are less careful in the matters of religion, pay their dues for my sake, because sadqa has been forbidden to them.\"\nThe day of distinction is the day of the battle of Badr.\n"

It was done so because Allah had decided to make the battle of Badr a landmark and a criterion for the believers as well as the disbelievers. The pagans of Makka came to know after the battle of Badr that Allah was on the side of the truth, the believers, otherwise a handful of poorly equipped men could never overpower a large army of formidable strength.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Holy Prophet and his successors (the Imams among his Ahl ul Bayt) were free from hallucination in dream or wakefulness, but Allah had communicated His decisions to His chosen representatives in their dreams-In verse 102 of Saffat Ibrahim said to Ismail: \"O my son I saw in a dream that I was sacrificing you\", to which Ismail replied: \"Father, do as you are commanded.\" The interpretation of Ibrahim was indicative whereas the interpretation of Ismail was imperative. Similarly the qualitative weakness of the enemy was shown to the Holy Prophet in terms of numerical weakness. Figurative expression of a fact to achieve success for a just cause is called tawriyah.\n"

All baser motives (territory, trade, revenge or military glory-\"temporal goods of this world\") are strictly excluded. The greed of gain in the form of ransom from captives has no place in such warfare.\nIt is reported that once some people asked Ali as to why he always went in the battlefield astride a mule when all the great warriors used thorough bred horses, Ali said: \"A thorough bred horse is needed either to run away from the battle when odds against the warrior are very heavy or to pursue the escaping enemy to collect their possessions-neither of which I do, therefore I do not need a thorough bred horse.\"\nAlthough some companions (Abu Bakr, Sad bin Ma-adh and others) advised the Holy Prophet either to take ransom from the captives of Badr or kill them but the Holy Prophet decided to set those free who could not pay ransom, yet the companions collected ransom from every captive in contravention of the directions of the Holy Prophet. The next day the Holy Prophet told Abu Bakr that due to the greed of the Muslims the chastisement of Allah was as near as the tree standing close to them. Then this verse was revealed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nFor the first portion of the verse refer to verse 4 of Muhammad-the enemy soldiers should be killed while the battle is in progress but as soon as they are thoroughly subdued, killing should be stopped. After that they can be held as captives, either to be set free after taking ransom or letting those go free who cannot pay ransom. In both the verses yuthkhina does not mean slaughtered but thoroughly subdued. It is the command of Allah to fight with unyielding courage until the enemy is thoroughly subdued.\nIn verse 7 it is stated that the Muslims desired to capture the caravan carrying merchandise instead of going to fight the Makkan army.\nTaking ransom from those who can pay it is allowed, but to say that yuthkhina means \"killing\" is to forge a lie against Allah. Some of the companions who were always afraid to fight the enemy in the battlefield wanted to kill them when they were held as helpless captives.\n"

Islam teaches man to keep in mind the fact that the whole world is like a masjid where every moment and every activity should be in the service of Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 9:25]\nImmediately after the conquest of Makka, the pagan idolaters, under the command of Malik bin Awf, organised a great gathering of 4000 soldiers near Hunayn which is on the road to Tayf from Makka to make plans for attacking the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet, with a force of 12000, marched towards Hunayn. For the first time the Muslims had tremendous odds in their favour. On leaving the narrow oasis of Hunayn the road enters winding gorges, suitable for ambuscades. As soon as the Muslim vanguard entered the hilly country, the enemy fell upon them with full fury and caused havoc with their arrows from their places of concealment. Many were slain, and many ran away from the battle as they had done in the battle of Uhad. Those who were acclaimed as the heroes of Islam, after the departure of the Holy Prophet from this world, were among the deserters.\nAbu Qatada says:\n\"The Muslims took to flight. I was also among them. Suddenly I saw Umar ibn Khattab among those who were running away. I asked him: 'What has happened?' He said: 'It is the will of Allah.'\"(Sahih Bukhari Vol. 3, p. 45.)\nAccording to some traditions Ali ibn abi Talib, Abbas ibn Abd al Muttalib, Abu Sufyan ibn Harith and Abdullah ibn Masud were the only four persons who stayed with the Holy Prophet. Some say there were ten persons who did not run away. Ali stood in front of the Holy Prophet and stopped every attack made by the enemy to slay him. The Holy Prophet called those who were deserting to come back. Some of them returned and joined Ali to launch a counter attack on the enemy. When Ali killed Abu Jarul, the standard bearer of the enemy army, a general retreat began to take place among the invaders, which soon turned into chaos and then flight. In this way a most crushing defeat was inflicted on the enemy.\nAfter the battle, on the instructions of the Holy Prophet, the spoils of war taken by the Muslims, were returned to those who embraced Islam. Some refused to comply with his orders. In such cases the Holy Prophet compensated them.\nWhen one companion protested that the Holy Prophet had not done justice in the matter of distributing the spoils of war, some people wanted to kill him, but the Holy Prophet stopped them and said: \"Wait. Such people, on their own, one day will go out of the true faith, then the best of men among you will kill him.\" And that man was killed by Ali in the battle of Nahrawan.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe believers who stayed with the Holy Prophet on the day of Hunayn also received the divine tranquillity (sakinah), along with the Holy Prophet. In verse 40 of this surah it is said that the companion of the Holy Prophet in the cave was deprived of this tranquillity.\n"

Apart from the corrupted and distorted beliefs of the people of the book (described in the succeeding verses) their denial and rejection of the true religion of Allah, Islam, is sufficient to put them in the category of disbelievers. The Jews and the Christians are the people of the book, and according to the jurists of the school of Ahl ul Bayt Zoroastrians are also included in the people of the book, because in verse 17 of al Hajj they have been grouped with the Jews and the Christians, and the Holy Prophet and Imam Ali also treated them in the same manner as the Jews and the Christians were treated.\nAllah enjoins upon the believers to fight against the disbelievers and the people of the book until they are subdued and agree to pay jizyah (the root meaning is compensation) with willing submission to live under the protection of Islam, enjoying personal liberty of conscience, free to profess and practice their own faith, not interfering with the preaching and progress of Islam. They were exempted from military service, therefore in effect jizyah was a nominal compensation paid by them in return for the protection of their property and lives for which the Islamic government was responsible .\nIt was a necessary step that had to be taken in view of the treacherous attitude of the Jews and the pagans who had been harassing and creating chaos all the time during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. When defeated they readily made pacts to avoid the consequences of the defeat, but always jumped at every opportunity to kill the Holy Prophet and the believers and destroy the progress of Islam by breaking promises and covenants and hatching secret schemes.\n"

The preference given to one individual over another by Allah or the Holy Prophet was due to the degree of submission to Allah and taqwa (piety). So the argument put forward by Umar bin Khattab at the time of deciding the issue of taking hold of the reins of power in the conference hall of Saqifa bani Sa-ada by reciting this verse without wa after ansar to establish the superiority of muhajirs over ansar (if wa is dropped it means the ansar should obey or follow the muhajirs) was unislamic or contrary to the teachings of the Quran. It is mentioned in Sahih Bukhari that when Obay ibn Ka-ab pointed out this omission Umar replied that he always thought this verse to be a proof of the muhajir's superiority over the ansar.\nThis verse and other verses like it in praise of the companions of the Holy Prophet, whether muhajirs or ansar, are applicable only to those who were sincere in faith. The hypocrites, who were also \"companions\" (sahabah) as per its definition laid down by the Muslim scholars, cannot be accepted as those praised by the Quran. So to say that all the companions, even the deserters, were true believers is illogical and contrary to historical facts.\nAll the commentators unanimously agree that \"the first of the foremost\" among women was Khadijah, wife of the Holy Prophet, and among men was Ali ibn abi Talib.\nHakim Nayshapuri, in his Mustadrak Alal Sahihayn, writes on page 22 of kitab al Ma-rafat:\n\"There is no difference of opinion among the historians that Ali ibn abi Talib was the first Muslim.\"\nIbn Abd al Bar, Qartabi, Suyuti, Tabarani, Bayhaqi and others also have confirmed it.\nPlease refer to the event of dawat dhil ashirah on page 4. Among others refer to Tarikh Tabari vol. 2, page 63, for authenticity of the tradition, according to which Ali was the first Muslim, and his faith was not only accepted by the Holy Prophet but also he was declared by him, whose words were always revelation revealed (Najm: 4), to be his brother, lieutenant and successor-and on that day obedience to him was made obligatory by the Holy Prophet for all the believers. Whosoever raises the issue of his age either does not know that whomsoever Allah wills He makes him His representative even if he is a baby in the cradle (Ali Imran: 46-Isa was a messenger of Allah in the cradle just as he was a messenger of Allah in maturity), or with ulterior motives, wants to introduce some one else as the first Muslim.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Ali prayed with me seven years before the other Muslims. He is the siddiq al akbar (the greatest truthful) and the faruq al azam (the greatest distinguisher of truth from falsehood). Whoso claims either of these titles is a liar.\"\n"

The Holy Prophet untied them only when this verse was sent down to him.\nOn being loosed those three persons presented the Holy Prophet with gifts which he refused saying that he could not accept anything from them unless he received Allah's command. Then verse 103 was revealed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Holy Prophet's prayer has been stated to be a source of security and assurance to those who pay zakat, khums and sadaqas, therefore there must be his representative, divinely commissioned like him, in all times, in every age, to pray for those who spend in the way of Allah as ordained by Him.

He went to Makka and encouraged and prepared the pagans to fight against the Holy Prophet. He took part in the battles of Uhad and Hunayn. Then he went to Hercules, the emperor of Byzantine empire, to raise an army to crush the Muslims. From there he wrote letters to his comrades (hypocrites in Madina) to build a masjid of their own, so that when he returned it could serve as a centre from where they could operate their plans against the Holy Prophet. At once the hypocrites built a masjid in Quba, a suburb of Madina, about 3 miles to the south-east, known as masjid dhirar (mischief). This place was selected because the Holy Prophet had rested in Quba for four days before entering the city on his emigration from Makka, and had built the first masjid there to which he frequently came to pray salat. It is said that offering of salat in this masjid is equal to one umrah.\nBy the time masjid dhirar was completed Abu Amir died in Syria.

There were two entirely different groups among the companions (sahabah), opposed to each other, in faith and character.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 9:113]\nAbu Talib followed the creed of Ibrahim, i.e. Islam. Abu Talib died as a Muslim before hijrat and this verse was revealed in 9 Hijra, therefore all the false traditions reported by the Muslim traditionists were fabricated by the enemies of Ali ibn abi Talib to present his father as an unbeliever.\nAbd al Muttalib, the Holy Prophet's grandfather, on his deathbed embraced Muhammad for the last time and then entrusted him to Abu Talib, saying: \"Take care of this boy, nothing in our kindred is more precious than he.\" Abu Talib affectionately brought him up, loved him fondly, made him sleep by his own bed-side and took him with himself wherever he went. History is a witness that, before Ali, it was Abu Talib who supported and assisted the Holy Prophet and his divine mission under all circumstances. In his sermons and poetry he praised his nephew as the messenger of Allah and expressed his faith in him and his belief in Allah.\nWhen Abu Talib saw his son, Ali, praying with the Holy Prophet to worship Allah, he gladly approved the act of devotion performed by his son and advised him to follow the Holy Prophet, help and support him in his mission.\nWhen the verse \"warn your relatives\" (Shu-ara: 214) was revealed, the dawat dhil ashira was arranged by the Holy Prophet in the house of Abu Talib. Abu Lahab, his other uncle tried his best to stop the Holy Prophet from delivering his speech but Abu Talib put his hands on Abu Lahab's shoulders and made him listen to the Holy Prophet's message, the message of Islam. He not only supported him in all his activities against the idolworshippers but also suffered untold hardships along with him when the pagans of Makka began the historic boycott of the Holy Prophet. They went in a body to Abu Talib, and adopting a threatening tone demanded of him to make his nephew desist from attacks on their gods. The Holy Prophet was present. He refused to do so. The Holy Prophet thought that his uncle, for fear of family feud, wanted to withdraw his protection, so he said to him that he solely depended on Allah, and turned to go away. Here it is reported by Abul Fida, Habib al Siyar and Asni-al Matalib that Abu Talib called him back and told him that he would stand by him against all his enemies and would protect him (in his mission) till his own death; because Abu Talib believed in his nephew's convictions, and he accordingly made the Makkans understand that his nephew was really a messenger from Allah; and therefore they should take him as their spiritual leader and guide. Tabari and Ibn Hisham write that urged by Abu Sufyan, the heads of the different families of idolworshippers decided to break off all connections with the Holy Prophet and his relatives. In the seventh year of bi-that a covenant was written-not to have any sort of intercourse with the Holy Prophet and his kinsmen, neither to sell to nor to buy anything from, nor to contract matrimonial alliance with them-and signed and sealed and was kept in the Ka-bah. Abu Talib then took the Holy Prophet and the Banu Hashim to his quarters known as Shib abi Talib. This fortress was also beleaguered occasionally by the idolworshippers of Makka, to enforce the boycott in all its rigour. Abu Talib feared even night attacks and was on his guard for the safety of the Holy Prophet, and often changed his bed-site as a precaution against sudden violence. This state of affairs lasted for about three years. Finally the Holy Prophet told Abu Talib that Allah had shown His disapproval of the covenant against him, and had sent worms to eat out every word of the document placed in the Ka-bah, excepting His own name written thereon. Abu Talib, believing his nephew as the receiver of revelations from Allah, unhesitatingly went to the idolworshippers and told them what the Holy Prophet had spoken; and added that if what he was telling was found true, they would be bound to withdraw their boycott and lay aside their enmity towards the Holy Prophet and his kinsmen; if proved false, he would withdraw his protection. They all agreed and at once went to inspect the document. Only the name of Allah was there and nothing more. They said that it was an enchantment of the Holy Prophet, but, at the persistence of Abu Talib the boycott was withdrawn. It is clear that only a believing man could do what Abu Talib did.\nIn the tenth year of bi-that, some months after the withdrawal of the interdict Abu Talib died at the age of 87 years. Abu Talib's attitude towards the Holy Prophet as well as some of his preserved verses prove, says Abul Fida, that he believed in the Holy Prophet as the true messenger of Allah and in his religion, Islam. He died actually in the faith with the kalimah on his lips. Some of his well-known verses are noted below:\n(i) I believe that Muhunmad's faith is the best of all the religions of the universe.\n(ii) Do you not see that we have found Muhammad, a prophet like Musa; he is already predicted in previous scriptures.\n(iii) To exalt him He (Allah) derived his name from His own; He as the highest is called Mahmud while He named him Muhammad.\nThe status of Abu Talib in Islam was the same as that of \"Mumin min ali Firawn\" (a believer from among the people of Firawn) mentioned in verses 28 to 45 of al Mumin who had concealed his faith to protect Musa-an instructive parallelism between Muhunmad and Musa. The enemies of Ali fabricated false traditions to give the impression that his father had not embraced Islam. In a malicious, nevertheless stupid, way they had tried their best to take revenge from Ali for having killed in various battles their fathers, the idolworshippers and hypocrites of Makka and Madina.\n"

In addition to the excessive heat and a long journey, provisions and water were so scarce that two men had to share a date between them.

The authentic books concur in reporting that this verse refers to the Ahl ul Bayt. See Hafiz Abu Nu-aym; Muwaffaq ibn Ahmad; and Ibn Hajar in his Saw-iq al Muhriqah, chap. 11, p. 90.\nFakhruddin al Razi in his Tafsir vol. 16, p. 220 and 221 accepts that only the sinless (ma-sumin)can be the truthful mentioned in this verse, but in order to include his heroes he says that all those who follow the right path are also the truthful. It cannot be, because Allah Himself has thoroughly purified some of His chosen servants (Ahzab: 33) so that other believers may remain attached with them as has been commanded in this verse. If all those who follow the right path are the truthful then who will remain attached with whom?\nPolytheism is the worst falsehood. Refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 124 to know that whoso has worshipped a ghayrallah (other then Allah) at any time in his life cannot inherit the imamah bestowed on Ibrahim. Allah had promised to bestow wilayah or imamah on those descendants of Ibrahim who, like Ali ibn abi Talib, had never worshipped any ghayrallah-a karramallahu wajhahu, and only Ali is known as the karramallahu wajhahu, the genuine truthful-and the Imams among the thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet.

In their insolence and pride they do not see how small and ephemeral is that which is mortal. By their pretensions they only hurt themselves. Verse 25 says that in contrast with the mortal life of this world, there is a higher life to which Allah is always calling. There is no fear, nor disappointment, nor sorrow there. All are called but only those will be chosen who have sought, not material advantages, but the good pleasure of Allah.\nSalam (peace) is from the same root as Islam, the religion of unity, harmony and bliss. Salam is also one of the holy names Allah is addressed with. To become a Muslim means to live in peace with the Creator-Lord by submitting to His will and to be in peace with His creation, particularly mankind. The peace of this world leads to the peace or bliss of the hereafter. Refer to the commentary of al Fatihah: 6 and 7 for the \"right path.\"\n"

As stated in Aqa Mahdi Puya's note in the commentary, of al Baqarah: 78 the Holy Prophet is the perfect example of such a guide. In view of the Holy Prophet's saying: \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\", Ali enjoys the same status. The source of his unique wisdom (glimpses of which are found in the Nahj al Balagha) was either the divine endowment or his constant companionship with the Holy Prophet. Likewise every one of the holy Imams from among the Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet was a guide for mankind. Imam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir said that the guides referred to in this verse are the twelve holy Imams from among the Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet, whom Allah has thoroughly purified (Ahzab: 33). All other claimants are impostors.\nAllah has made available to mankind the guidance and the guides. There is no compulsion in the matter of faith as has been made clear in verse 3 of Ad Dahr:\n\"Verily we have shown him the (right) path that he may either be grateful (accept it) or ungrateful (reject it).\"\nIf guided by this verse, the Muslims can never accept the immah or wilayah of any other than Ali ibn abi Talib, as the true successor of the Holy Prophet.\nJalal al Din al Suyuti, in Tarikh al Khulafa, says:\n(1) Ahmad ibn Hanbal says: \"There has not come down to us regarding the merits of anyone of the companions of the Holy Prophet what has been transmitted concerning Ali.\"\n(2) Ibn Asakir from Ibn Abbas says: \"There has not been revealed in the book of Allah, the Quran, regarding any one what has been revealed concerning Ali and that 300 verses have been revealed concerning Ali.\"\n(3) Tabarani and Ibn Abi Hatim relate from Ibn Abbas that he said: \"Allah never revealed the words 'O True believers' but Ali was understood to be the lord and chief of them, and verily Allah has reproved the various people but has never mentioned Ali save with approval.\"\n(4) Tirmidhi, Nisa-i and Ibn Maja relate from Habshi Bin Junada that the Holy Prophet said: \"Ali is part of me and I am part of Ali.\"\n(5) Tabarani relates in Awsat that Ummi Salmah narrated: 'I heard the Holy Prophet say: \"Ali is with Quran and Quran is with Ali, they shall not be separated until they arrive at the fountain of Kawthar in paradise.\"\n(6) Tabarani relates in Awsat from Jabir bin Abdullah that the Holy Prophet said, \"The people are of various stocks but I and Ali are of one stock.\"\n(7) Ibn Sad records on the authority of Ali that he said: \"By Allah a verse of the Quran was never revealed but I know for what it was revealed, where it was revealed, and for whom it was revealed, because my Lord has given unto me a wise heart and an eloquent tongue.\"\n(8) Ibn Sad and others relate on the authority of Abu Tufayl that Ali said: \"Ask me regarding the book of Allah, for verily there is not a verse but I know whether it was revealed by night or by day, in the plains or on the mountains.\"\n(9) Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim relate from Ali that the Holy Prophet said: \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate.\"\n(10) Tabarani relates from Ummi Salmah that the Holy Prophet said: \"He who loves Ali verily loves me, and he who hates Ali verily hates me, and he who hates me, verily hates Allah.\"\n(11) Abu Yula and Al-Bazzaz relate from Sad bin Abi Waqqas that the Holy Prophet said: \"He who grieves Ali, grieves me.\"\n(12) Ahmad relates and Al-Hakim confirms it on the authority of Ummi Salmah, who narrated: \"I heard the Holy Prophet say: 'verily he who reviles Ali, reviles me.'\n(13) Sad Ibn Al-Musayyib says that Umar bin Khattab used to pray to Allah to save him from a perplexing case for which Abul Hasan (Ali) was not present to decide, and that Umar said: \"None of the companions used to throw the challenge \"Ask me\" except Ali.\"\n(14) Tabarani says in the Awsat that Ibn Abbas said: \"Ali possessed 18 eminent qualities which belonged to no other of the people.\"\n( 15) The two Shaykhs (Bukhari and Muslim) relate on the authority of Sad bin Abi Waqqas that the Holy Prophet left Ali bin Abi Talib behind him as his vicegerent during the expedition to Tabuk, and Ali said: \"O Prophet of Allah, do you leave me behind, among the women and children?\" He replied: \"Are you not content to be to me in the relation of Harun to Musa save that there shall be no prophet after me?\"\nPlease refer to the commentary of al Ma-idah: 67 to know about the open and clear declaration of the imamah and wilayah of Ali ibn abu Talib by the Holy Prophet under the command of Allah, after which there remains no excuse to accept and follow any other guide after the Holy Prophet.\nAll men have to obey Allah alone, but Allah has not created all men as believers. Most of them are beguiled by Shaytan. Verse 2 of Ankabut clearly says that whosoever professes belief shall be tried and tested. Verse 2 of al Mulk says that Allah created life and death in order to try and test mankind to see who of them are best by way of deeds. So the divine plan is to make available guidance and guides to mankind in the life of this world and give them freedom of choice in order to test and try the true mettle of each and every individual. It is every person's own responsibility to find out the true guidance and guides by making use of his or her knowledge, observation and intelligence, because there is no compulsion in religion (Baqarah: 256). Those who hold fast to the rope of Allah (the thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt) make a correct judgment and follow the right path (see commentary of Ali Imran: 103).\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAllah invites man to accept His creative authority. As soon as man does so he has to follow and obey His legislative authority which implies obedience to His messenger, and in his absence, to the divinely appointed Imam (refer to the commentary of al Ma-idah: 55), and to the institution of \"ijtihad and taqlid' based upon the teachings of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt. In her address to the then ruling authority, Bibi Fatimah had pointed out and established the necessity of prophethood and imamat on the basis of this verse (refer to the Biography of Bibi Fatimah, published by this Trust). The authority to administer the affairs of mankind should be vested in a person who is divinely endowed to guide people to the truth, and not in a person who cannot distinguish between right and wrong or between good and evil (see commentary of Ali Imran: 101 to 115-Aqa Puya's note).\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad al Sadiq had rejected the theory of Mutazilites (that khilafah should be elected by adult franchise) by quoting the Holy Prophet (who said):\n\"Whoever draws the sword and calls people to obey him while there is a more learned man among the Muslims than he, is a straying impostor.\"\nThis verse and verse 24 of Zukhruf prove that one should always follow the guidance of the best and the most learned authority-the basis of the doctrine of \"ijtihad and taqlid\".\n"

This life is testing time, but the disbelievers, who do not believe in a future life of the hereafter, think all talk of it is like a sorcerer's talk, empty of reality.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nWater, the perennial matter, from which the physical universe (terrestrial and celestial bodies) has been formed, is described as liquid, amenable to take any form, to prove that there is no limit to the possibility of development or, change in the matter, which implies a free competition in the process of continuity and progress. However perfect one may be, the possibility of further perfection is always there to try and attain, for which the Quran asks the Holy Prophet to pray in verse 114 of Ta Ha.\nAfter dealing with the process and purpose of creation, the reference to \"raising up after death\" may either refer to the present state in which man is (when he is nothing, unworthy of mention-Dahr: 1) or to the resurrection as the consequence of the life of this world. The raising up after death through an evolutionary process, which the Quran frequently mentions, appears as a fascinating but unreliable statement to the ignorant disbelievers, therefore they say it is a sorcery.\n"

True reflection of character and spiritual attainment is the basis of the thorough purification.\nAlthough Kanan was his son, Allah says to Nuh that verily he is not of his family, because he was an infidel and did not have the qualities of his father. Birth or ancestry has no value at all. Salman, an outsider, was accepted as one among his Ahl ul Bayt by the Holy Prophet on the basis of his faith and piety.

Imam Ali bin Musa ar Rida said: Like the accursed son of Nuh, whoso is of us, but does not obey Allah's commands and follow the sunnah of the Holy Prophet, ceases to be of us; and those who call themselves our followers (Shi-ahs) but do not carry out the commands of Allah and His Prophet are not our Shi-ahs at all.

So the oft-quoted tradition of the Holy Prophet that \"differences among my followers are a blessing\" must be discarded as spurious or interpreted in a way that does not go against this verse.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 12:3]\nThe story of Yusuf son of Yaqub son of Is-haq son of Ibrahim as given in the Quran is not identical with the Biblical story. The atmosphere is wholly different. The Biblical story is a folk-tale in which morality has no place. It exalts the clever and financially-minded Jew against the Egyptian, and to explain certain ethnic and tribal peculiarities in later Jewish history, Yusuf is shown as buying up all the cattle and the land of the poor Egyptians for the state under the stress of famine conditions, and making the Jews \"rulers\" over the Firawn's cattle. The Quranic story, on the other hand, is less a narrative than a highly spiritual sermon or allegory explaining the seeming contradictions in life, the enduring nature of virtue in a world full of flux and change, and the marvellous working of Allah's eternal purpose in His plan as unfolded to us on the wide canvas of history.\nImam Ali said to Imam Hasan:\n\"O my son, although I have not lived with the people gone by but I have so closely studied their deeds, the events which took place, and the traditions and vestiges they have left behind, as if I have become one of them, as if I have lived with the first and the last of them\".\n(Nahj al Balagha)\nIt is the most detailed of any story in the Quran and is full of description of vicissitudes of human life, and therefore deservedly appeals to men and women of all classes. It paints in vivid colours, with their spiritual implications, the most varied aspects of life-Yaqub's old age and the confidence between him and his little beloved son, the elder brothers' jealousy, their plot, Yaqub's grief, the sale of Yusuf into slavery for a petty price, carnal love contrasted with purity and patience and fortitude, chastity, false charges, prison, the divine gift of interpretation of the dreams, evil life and spiritual life, innocence raised to honour, forgiveness and benevolence, matters of administration, humility in glory, filial love, and the ultimate triumph of piety and truth.\nWhen the tribal chiefs of the Quraysh asked the Holy Prophet about the cause of the migration of the children of Yaqub to Egypt from Syria, this surah was revealed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nExcept four verses (the first three and the seventh according to Ibn Abbas) this surah was revealed in Makka on the eve of the Holy Prophet's migration to Madina. If true, it proves that the date and the sequence of the revelations were not taken into consideration by the Holy Prophet.\nIt must be noted that like Yusuf the Holy Prophet also had to leave his birth place on account of the conspiracy of his near relatives. This surah gave confidence and hope to him that they would also encounter the same fate as the brothers of Yusuf met. Like Yusuf the Holy Prophet also declared clemency for his relatives and tribesmen. After the fall of Makka he said: \"I say that which my brother Yusuf said to his brothers in the end.\"\nYusuf son of Yaqub was a very beautiful youth. The truth, which Yusuf, the prophet of Allah, saw in his vision, was unpalatable to his half-brothers, who plotted against him and sold him into slavery to a merchant for a few pieces of silver. Yusuf was taken by the merchant into Egypt, was bought by a great Egyptian court dignitary, Aziz. The beauty of Yusuf was so irresistible that the dignitary's wife fell in love with him on first sight and sought to entice Yusuf to the delights of earthly love, but Yusuf, a faithful servant of Allah and His prophet, did not yield to the temptation. His self-control and faith in Allah could not be shaken just for the pleasure of a fleeting moment. He preferred the misery of imprisonment to the disgrace he would have to face if he had succumbed to the lure of Shaytan.\nAlthough some commentators have given many notes of mystic nature connected with the story of Yusuf, yet it is advisable to rely upon that which has been narrated in the Quran.\nThe knowledge and wisdom of the Holy Prophet is based upon the revelations sent to him from Allah. These verses narrate the story of Yusuf. Those who want to know other details, not mentioned in the Quran, may refer to the \"Glimpses of the Prophets\", an English translation of Hayat ul Qulub, published by this Trust.\nYusuf, born of Yaqub's beloved wife Rachel, occupied the first place in his father's affections. Rachel gave birth to another child, Benjamin, Yusuf's real brother, after which she died. When Yusuf was about twelve years of age he dreamed a dream in which he saw a light had enveloped the whole environment. Every creature was singing the song of Allah's glory. Then the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to him. As soon as Yaqub, also a prophet of Allah, heard this dream, he knew its interpretation immediately.\n(It is reported on the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah Ansari that one day Bashan, a Jew of Madina, came to the Holy Prophet and asked him whether he knew the names of the stars which Yusuf saw in his dream. The Holy Prophet gave him the following names:\nHurban,\nTuraq,\nZi-al,\nZulkitfani,\nQabisth,\nWathab,\nAmud,\nFaluq,\nMasbah,\nSaduh,\nZul Qarh.)\nYaqub advised Yusuf not to relate his dream to his brothers who hated and envied him because they saw that their father loved him more than all of them, and that Yusuf was a very beautiful boy, a gift of Allah bestowed on him as a distinctive excellence.\nThere was a tree in Yaqub's house. Whenever a son was born, a new branch used to grow on the tree. As soon as that son reached puberty, Yaqub would cut the branch and give it to the boy to be used as a staff. On the birth of Yusuf no such branch grew. Yaqub prayed to Allah. In reply Allah sent a heavenly branch for Yusuf. The brothers envied him for this divine favour. Yusuf dreamed another dream that all the brothers planted their staves in the earth, but his staff grew higher and higher and reached the sky. Then a violent storm destroyed the staves of his brothers, leaving his staff intact. Yaqub told him that the dream showed his high position near Allah. His brothers became furious with jealousy and hatred-all negative and wicked characteristics are the promptings of Shaytan, an open enemy of man.\nAs a chosen prophet of Allah Yusuf had to understand and interpret signs and events aright. The dreams of the righteous prefigure events correctly. Yusuf could look back to his fathers upto Ibrahim, the upright, who through all adversities kept his faith pure and won through.\nIn Yusuf's story there is good and evil contrasted in many different ways.\nThe brothers of Yusuf proposed to kill him so that the favour of their father might be given to them alone, but one of them suggested to throw him in a well, in which case some travellers passing by would pick him up and remove him to a far country and they would be free from the charge of murder. The plot having been formed, they approached their father to let Yusuf go with them to play and enjoy. Yaqub had strong misgivings and apprehension. He told them that while they were attending to their own affairs a wolf might devour him. In the end they prevailed upon him and took Yusuf with them, and threw him into a well. Allah was with Yusuf in his sufferings and sorrows and reassured him that one day they would stand before him, seeking his help, not knowing that he was their betrayed brother. They stained Yusuf's shirt with the blood of a goat and showed it to their father to convince him that while they were playing a wolf had devoured Yusuf who was guarding their things. Yaqub did not believe them. He saw that there had been some foul play.\n"

For the merchants Yusuf was an item of merchandise. The brothers, who were visiting the well daily, came to claim his price as a runaway slave, but dared not haggle over the price, lest their plan, to get rid of him, should be defeated. The shrewd merchants bought Yusuf for the paltry sum of a few dirhams. In Egypt, a high court official purchased him when he was put for sale in a public auction. He took him to his house and instructed his wife to make his stay honourable so that they might adopt him as a son. So Allah firmly established Yusuf in the land and taught him the interpretation of dreams, and when he reached the prime of life He gave him wisdom and knowledge, because Allah rewards those who are good. The wife of the high official, Zulaykha, tried to seduce him. She desired him very much. As Yusuf was one of Allah's chosen devotees, He enabled him to avert both evil and lechery from himself. She grabbed and rent his shirt from behind. Both of them raced to the door. There they met her husband outside the door. At once she saw the trouble and put the blame on Yusuf and said: 'There is no other penalty for a man who wanted to outrage your wife but imprisonment or grievous punishment.\" Yusuf said that it was she who wanted to seduce him. He had to tell the truth. A witness from her family testified. Yusuf's shirt was torn at the back, he must obviously have been retreating and Zulaykha must have been tugging from behind. Everybody knew the guilty party. The husband was convinced that indeed it was a woman's ruse-the wiles of women are terrible. He asked Yusuf to ignore the affair and ordered his wife to ask forgiveness for her sin.\nIn the city the women gossiped. When she heard their slanderings, she invited them to a sumptuous feast and gave each of them a knife and called Yusuf to come out before them. When they saw him, the women were so wonderstruck with his beauty that they cut their hands.\n"

It implies wonder at the power of Allah as manifested in the creation of a beautiful person like Yusuf.]\nThe women all agreed that no man had a right to resist their solicitations, so Zulaykha, in her tragic guilt, threatened Yusuf with imprisonment and disgrace. Yet, inspite of having seen the clear proofs of his innocence, the men, as a political move, sent him to prison for a time, until the scandalous gossip of the town regarding the high official's wife had ceased.\nThere came into the prison two young men with him. They were employed in the court of Firawn. One was a cup-bearer, and the other was a cook. They were both in disgrace. The former dreamed that he was pressing grapes, the latter that he was carrying bread, but the birds ate of it. They saw in Yusuf a man of Cod endowed with His wisdom, therefore told him their dreams and asked him to interpret them. Refer to verse 21. First Yusuf taught the truth of Allah and the faith in the hereafter to both men. It was his mission, his duty. The highest good he could do to them was to teach the polytheist Egyptians the gospel of unity of Allah. He had the heritage of great men renowned for wisdom and truth such as Ibrahim, Is-haq and Yaqub, whose faith he followed, and all of them never associated anyone with Allah- belief in one Allah is a grace of Allah to mankind. All false gods are nothing but names that polytheists have named for which there is no divine sanction. Sovereignty belongs to Allah alone, therefore, worship none but Him-this is the right religion.\n"

He asked the cup-bearer to mention him to his master, but Shaytan made him forget to mention this to his master, and Yusuf remained in prison for a few more years. One day the king told his courtiers that he saw in a dream seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of corns and seven others that were withered.

Although they did as advised by Yaqub but it did not profit them against the plan of Allah - reunion of the whole family and shaming the ten brothers into repentance. The men of Allah are full of knowledge, not as men, but as taught by the grace of Allah.\nYusuf was delighted to see Benjamin, his own brother. He told him not to worry as he was going to keep Benjamin with himself. After taking the provisions, when they were departing Yusuf asked a steward to put his own drinking silver cup in Benjamin's saddle-bag; and then it was announced that Yusuf s silver cup had been stolen. As they were about to leave a steward stopped them and searched their bags, and found the silver cup in Benjamin's bag. So he was detained.

All the terrestrial and the celestial distances will disappear. There will be no past, present and future. All will be before the Lord together to be judged.\nCONCLUSION\nIbrahim's prayer forms the core of this surah.\nRevelation (the Quran) leads man from darkness to light-the light of true knowledge about Allah and His omnipotent authority and sovereignty which He shares with no one. The whole universe (all that has been created by Him) willingly or unwillingly submit to His will and command. He sent His messengers to teach each nation in its own language and for its own special circumstances. There was a conflict of evil with good in the times of every prophet but evil was destroyed and good was preserved by the grace of Allah which man must always remember and give thanks to his Lord.\nThankfulness increases His blessings and ingratitude takes them away.\nMiracles take place only when Allah wills. They cannot be shown to people as a sport or pastime particularly to such type of people whose ignorance and arrogance keep them from learning a lesson from the miracles shown by many prophets of Allah.\nThe disbelievers shall be punished and hell will be their final abode where they will abide for ever. The believers always rely upon Allah and adhere to the divinely chosen guides appointed by Him to guide mankind. They shall live in paradise for ever. The Holy Prophet, his Ahl ul Bayt and the religion of Allah they preached and practised have been compared to a goodly tree which bears fruits in all seasons. The disbelievers and the hypocrites are compared to an evil tree which shall be uprooted and destroyed for ever.\nIn Ibrahim's prayer there is a mention of the people who pray for Allah's grace so that He keeps them attached with the godly family of Ibrahim. This family of Ibrahim is in fact the family of the Holy Prophet-the Ahl ul Bayt. No evil force of the world can prevent the march of Islam."

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 15:16]\nIn the countless stars in the universe there is a marvellous order, beauty and harmony, on a scale which man is appreciating more and more as his knowledge is increasing. The first distinct belt is the Zodiac, which marks the position of the sun with reference to the movement of various constellation of stars of the solar system. Its twelve divisions are called the signs of the Zodiac. Through them we can mark off the seasons in our solar year, and express in definite laws the most important facts in meteorology, agriculture, seasonal winds, and tides. All these are vitally important and affect our physical life on the earth. The most important lesson we draw from them is that the author of the wonderful order and beauty is One, and He alone is entitled to our worship.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Zodiac belt is the lowest heaven. The heavens above it are more spiritual than physical. Celestial factors effect the terrestrial events. Some of the determinative occurrences of the celestial realm manifest themselves before they produce an effect upon the terrestrial world. Those who delve in occult sciences rely upon these manifestations to foretell the future. Such attempts are not reliable because the radiating celestial bodies (shihabun mubin or shahab thaqib) prevent them from reading the actual consequences. The shooting star or flaming fire, most probably, is the continuous radiation from the celestial bodies which pierces into the terrestrial hemisphere. It may mean that the conjunctions of radiations from different celestial sources neutralise the effect of each other and it becomes immeasurable and incomprehensible to those who try to foretell the future.\nSpiritually speaking, order, beauty, harmony, light and truth are repugnant to evil. Therefore the bliss of the heavens are denied to the forces of evil. It is reserved only for the virtuous. The crooked nature of evil try to gain access by fraud or stealth but a flaming fire stops them from even hearing the sound of harmony ringing in the land of eternal bliss.\nQummi in his commentary says that when the Holy Prophet was born a mass of shooting stars was seen in the sky. A Jew named Joseph came to Makka and asked the Quraysh if a male child was born in their tribe. They did not know, but when he told them that it was written in Pentateuch that when the last prophet of Allah would be born the devilish forces will be driven away from the heaven by the shooting stars and their access to the higher regions would be blocked for ever, they made inquiries and found out that in the night before a son was born to Abdullah bin Abd al Muttalib. In the same night the palace of Kisra in Persia was cracked and the fire burning in the temple for a thousand years was extinguished .\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 17:1]\nThis verse is about the physical ascension (mi-raj) of the Holy Prophet to the highest station in the heaven.\nThe mi-raj; is usually dated to the 27th night of the month of Rajab in the year before hijrat. While the Holy Prophet finished his night prayers in the house of his cousin, Ummi Hani, the sister of Ali ibn Abu Talib, the angel Jibra-il came to him with the invitation of the Lord of the worlds to have a journey to the highest heaven. Jibrail first took him to the Ka-bah (the Masjid al Haram) and from there he was taken to the farthest masjid in the heavens. Although aqsa means \"the farthest\" but most of the translators and commentators confuse this word with the name of Masjid al Aqsa in Jerusalem. Farthest is an adjective used to refer to the masjid in the most distant heaven. The distance between the Masjid al Haram and the Masjid al Aqsa in Jerusalem is not more than a few hundred miles which cannot be described as farthest. Moreover, the journey to Jerusalem was meaningless when the divine purpose was to show the Holy Prophet the wonders of the glory of the kingdom of Allah. If Allah had selected an earthly place to do this He could have chosen the Masjid al Hama.\nAccording to the Ahl ul Bayt the mi-raj was a physical ascension, not a vision or dream in sleep or slumber, because even ordinary men see such things in their dreams. It was no doubt a spiritual realisation but attained by an actual journey. To bring the position of the Holy Prophet to the level of ordinary mortals, A-isha and Mu-awiyah had reported that the mi-raj; was only a vision. In view of what history and traditions say about the credibility of these two reporters, a large number of Sunni authorities have rejected their point of view and have accepted the fact that it was a physical ascension. Please refer to Aqa Puya's essay \"Genuineness of the Holy Quran\" to know about what is written about A-isha in Sahih Bukhari, and as for Mu-awiyah there are no two opinions about his hostility towards the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, and for his deceit, cunning and falsehood refer to At Tahrim: 4 and Muhammad: 22. Those who doubt the great miracle of the physical ascension of the Holy Prophet wrought by Allah should also doubt as to how Allah could create the universe out of nothing, or how He could make virgin Maryam give birth to Prophet Isa, or how could Isa preach the message of Allah from his cradle as a just born infant, or how could Allah split the sea to save Musa; and how could the several other miracles mentioned in the Quran take place if the doubters insist upon empirical justifications. The physical journey of the Holy Prophet to the arsh in the highest heaven known as mi-raj; is an unheard of wonder of the world since its beginnings and shall remain so to its end as the greatest miracle of the Almighty Lord of the worlds.\nAmong the celestial lights, where he received from Allah order for the five daily prayers, he saw his own name together with that of Ali inscribed in the kalimah.\n\"There is no god save Allah, Muhammad is His Prophet and Ali is His wali.\"\nIn the heaven Allah showed him Ali and said:\n\"O my Prophet Muhammad, I have given you Ali to be your vicegerent and successor. Peace be on you from your Lord, and His grace and His bounties.\"\nThen all the secrets of creation and what happened in the world since its creation and what will take place were disclosed to the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet said:\n\"Peace from the Lord be on all the righteous servants of Allah, and peace be on all of you (O angels), and His grace and His bounties.\"\nWhen the Holy Prophet returned to Makka from his journey, before he related his experience, Ali began to give every detail of his journey, which proves that in every single step the Holy Prophet had taken during his journey Ali was with him; and this is the reason on account of which the Holy Prophet said:\n\"I and Ali are of one and the same light.\"\nIn the bygone days ignorance might have prevented people to believe in the physical ascension of the Holy Prophet as the most beloved friend of Allah-habiballah, and his having attained the highest and the subtlest realisation of Allah's being, and seeing Ali face to face in the highest heaven, but there is no ground for the people of this age to deny it in the midst of advancement of science and technology, the step by step awareness of the laws, made by Allah, governing the operation of the universe, with the help of which man is exploring the so far unknown frontiers in the space.\nAlso refer to the commentary of An Najm: 8 and 9 and books of history for the event of mi-raj.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe terms ascension and descension are used to explain the order of creation and the movement of cognitive self through the various spheres of finite beings to the absolute and from there coming down again through the various spheres of abstract and spiritual beings, of more comprehensive nature, to the lowest finite world. This journey is intellectual as well as visual.\nThe intellectual journey is experienced by all seekers of truth with the help of spiritual faculties, not bound by the physical senses. The visual journey begins from the highest point of the intellectual achievement, using it as a base, and proceeds upwards through the various spheres of the spiritual beings to higher and still higher levels till it reaches the absolute, and again comes down to its base. There was no prophet who did not have this visual experience of ascension and descension, and, as said in al Baqarah: 253, each had it in keeping with his potential, during sleep or wakefulness or in a state in between them, once in a lifetime or often times as the Holy Prophet had done. being the superior-most of them all. Not only the Holy Prophet but also his divinely commissioned successors (the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt) who, in soul and body, were from him and 11e from them, and all of them were of one and the same divine light and origin, had the visual experience of ascension to the absolute many a time,\nThe Quran in verse 33 of Ar-Rahman says that man can cross the bounds of the heavens and the earth if he possesses the authority and has the power (knowledge of the laws enforced by Allah) to do so. Therefore the theories based on ignorance from the laws made by Allah should not\nbe given any importance when they are put forward to deny not only the physical ascension of the Holy Prophet but also all the miracles wrought by the prophets of Allah and His chosen representatives .\nBesides Ali ibn abi Talib and the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt, a great number of reliable companions and scholars such as Ibn Abbas, Ibn Masud, Jabir bin Abdullah Ansari, Hudhayfah and Ummi Hani have confirmed the disappearance of the Holy Prophet from his bed in the house of Ummi Hani. So far as the physical and the dimensional aspect of the journey is concerned, it was undoubtedly physical. There is no logical, reasonable and scientific argument to prove its impossibility. As the end of the ascension was the full realisation of the aosolute, while passing the boundaries of physical realm, under the influence of divine light, his whole physical aspect was totally spiritualised and transcended the properties of substance and corporeality. It was a total transcendence of the Holy Prophet into a spiritual entity. Descension means his reappearance in his physical form. Only those who know and believe that he was a light, the first created being, and the last and final messenger of Allah can understand his ascension to the farthest stage where Allah's cognition is achieved in the highest realm of creation, referred to in this verse as the masjid al aqsa, the environment of which is blessed by His signs shown to the Holy Prophet.\nMany a traditionists and commentators has dealt with his ascension at length in detail. A few points discussed by the great scholar Tabrasi in his commentary, Majma-ul Bayan, are stated below.\nThe physical ascension in the state of wakefulness has to be accepted. There is no doubt in it.\nSome of the details given by the traditionists and commentators about what the Holy Prophet did and said during his ascension journey are not reasonable and in agreement with the articles of the faith. There is no room for any proper interpretation except that he visited the heavens, met all the prophets, saw paradise and hell, and fully comprehended the operation of the absolute omnipotent authority of Allah, but all that which is narrated about his talking to Allah seeing Him and sitting with Him on the arsh should be totally rejected because it is out-and-out anthropomorphism which is far from the glory and absoluteness of Allah.\nNeither was his chest opened nor washed, because he was free from all evil (dirt), and if there was any spiritual dirt, washing with water would have not served the purpose. All this nonsense was evidently borrowed from anthropomorphist theories of the pagan and Christian creeds by the thoughtless narrators who thought that they should also attribute to their prophet all that which the others had done to their religious leaders.\n"

Ibn Musa quoted the above noted tradition. Then Mamun returned the land of Fadak to the children of Bibi Fatimah. The land the Jews left without a heir was distributed by the Holy Prophet, as commanded by Allah (see Anfal: 1), with the consent of the ansar, among the muhajirin who had abandoned their properties in Makka and were almost living on dole. Many gardens and tracts of land, Bibi Fatimah inherited from her mother, Bibi Khadijah, were in and around Makka. Through this verse Allah directed the Holy Prophet to give Bibi Fatimah her due rights. So he gave her the garden of Fadak in fulfilment of her share as a muhajir and also included his own share in it. During the lifetime of the Holy Prophet the land of Fadak was in the active possession of Bibi Fatimah, but after the departure of the Holy Prophet from this world, the first caliph seized the land. The evidence of Ali, Hasan and Husayn and her own was rejected, notwithstanding their truthfulness made known to the people by Allah through Ali Imran: 61 and Ahzab: 33. Her claim as the inheritor of the Holy Prophet was also rejected. Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari inform us that Umar used to point out Ali and Abbas as those who branded him and his predecessor as usurpers and liars in connection with the property of Fadak, and neither Ali nor Abbas ever denied it. Bibi Fatimah, after this incident, never talked to Abu Bakr and Umar, and asked Ali not to allow them to attend her funeral prayers and burial. The confiscated property of Fadak was never used for the well-being of the people nor for the maintenance of the Muslim army.\nEvery Umayyid ruler treated the garden of Fadak as his personal property, except Umar ibn Abdul Aziz who, after making a thorough examination of the case, returned it to the Ahl ul Bayt. The Abbasi rulers again took it away from the Ahl ul Bayt and used it as their property, till Mamun al Rashid again conducted a thorough inquiry by a special court of jurists before which a follower of the Ahl ul Bayt advocated their case and the state attorney opposed his arguments. At the end Mamun wrote the judgement in the form of a royal edict, awarding the land to the Ahl ul Bayt, summary of which has been recorded by Balazuri in his famous book Futuhul Buldan. Ibn Abi Hadid has also given a brief account of the arguments, for and against, in his commentary of the Nahj al Balagha. Bibi Fatimah herself gave the strongest arguments in her favour in her address to the then ruling party. For full details refer to the \"Biography of Bibi Fatimah Zahra\", published by Peermahomed Ebrahim Trust.\n"

In the same manner the ancient people (refer to the verses of Al Araf and Hud pertaining to Nuh, Shu-ayb, Salih and Musa) showed their aversion to the true teachings of their messengers and challenged them to bring down the wrath of Allah on them. They were punished and destroyed. The Holy Prophet's mission was universal. It was not confined to any particular community, place and time. Allah did not want to inflict perdition in response to the challenge of a few ignorant people on the whole human race. So the Holy Prophet did not resort to such a destructive course during his ministry except at the time of mubahilah when Allah commanded him to take the decisive step, but the Christians declined to accept the challenge (see commentary of Ali Imran: 61). The Quran clearly says that threats cannot be like the convincing signs with which every messenger of Allah was sent among his people to prove his divine messengership.\nTo prove that the interpretation of ayat (signs) as communication or message exclusively is not true, the example of she-camel, sent to the Thamud in the days of prophet Salih, has been given (see commentary of Araf: 73 to 79).\nSee the commentary of al Baqarah: 118 and 243 to know that it is a malicious attempt to deny the powers of the Holy Prophet when some translators interpret the verse as \"We have not given you the power\" .\n"

There is no authentic tradition to support that either the vision refers to the conquest of Makka (Fat-h: 27) or the battle of Badr (Anfal: 43). According to the Ahl ul Bayt it refers to the dream (monkeys sitting on the Holy Prophet's pulpit) which Allah showed to him about a tribe (Bani Umayyah) from among his followers who had destroyed the spirit of Islam after him; that was a time of trial for the true believers. The Holy Prophet saw in his dream that like those Jews who did not believe and were cursed by Dawud and Isa (Ma-idah: 78 and 79) his followers would also deviate from the right path. but would not be able to harm the true faith because his Ahl ul Bayt would he there to safeguard the religion of Allah from the mischief of the deviating monkeys.\nThe cursed tree may refer to the evil tree mentioned in Ibrahim: 26.\nIt is also a warning to the mischief-makers, but they pay no heed, and on the contrary they boldly transgress more and more.\n"

Blessed are they who follow the true guides (imams) of the Ahl ul Bayt, chosen by Allah and appointed by the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet said:\n\"Verily I am the Imam among you.

To follow a scripture means to follow the prophet who brought it to the people. Moreover both of them together take their true followers to salvation. Nowhere in the Quran or in the traditions it is stated that they may also lead their followers to hell, but it is said that there are two types of Imams-\"We appointed Imams, from among them, to guide (mankind) by our command (Sajdah: 24); and \"We made them Imams who invite to the fire (Qasas: 41).

They are his Ahl ul Bayt.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Whosoever dies without recognising the Imam of his age dies the death of a pagan.\"\nAfter making it clear that there will be an Imam from his progeny in every age, he gave the number of Imams as twelve, neither more nor less. In fact it was a covenant Allah made with Ibrahim that among his descendants there would be twelve princes (Imams) in the progeny of Ismail. See commentary of Al Baqarah: 124.\nThis verse says that all human beings in groups shall be called with their respective Imams. The identity of the true Imams will be their inseparability with the scripture and the Holy Prophet- they will lead to eternal salvation. Those who opposed these Imams in their lifetime and installed themselves as the leaders or rulers without any divine authority shall be the leaders mentioned in Qasas: 41 who will lead their followers to hell because they opposed the book, the Holy Prophet and Allah.\nOn the day of resurrection the people will be divided in the following groups:\n(i) Those who are most excellent and nearest to Allah.\n(ii) Ashab ul maymanah-the followers of the book of Allah, the Holy Prophet and the Imams of his Ahl ul Bayt, the most excellent and nearest to Allah.\n(iii) Ashab ul mash-amah-the opponents of the first and the second groups.\nRefer to the opening verses of al waqi-ah.\nAlso refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 143; Nisa: 41 ; Hud: 18 and 98; and Nahl: 84 and 89.\n"

(Nisa: 171).\n(iv) The Quran as mentioned in Shura: 52.\n(v) The spirit which comes down in the night of qadr with the angels (Quran: 4).\n(vi) The spirit which will stand with the angels on the day of resurrection. (Naba: 38)\n(vii) The holy ghost (Ma-idah: 11).\n(viii) The spirit sent to Maryam which appeared before her as a man. (Maryam: 17).\nBesides the Quranic use, the word spirit was in vogue among the pagans of Arabia, India, Europe, Africa and other places, attributing to the spirit all the aspects and happenings they could not explain in terms of cause and effect. The reference here is not particular but to that which is unseen and immeasurable but present in human body as an active agent which gives awareness to man, not obtainable through observation and experiment, or produces extraordinary happenings in human society and other physical realms .\nThe ancient philosophers had diverse opinions about the spirit in its general sense and did not have a clear definition. They were not sure whether it is created or uncreated. Some Indian and Greek schools of thought expounded the idea that both spirit and matter are uncreated, therefore the existence of a third agent, who controls these two as God, was a disputed issue among them. They also disputed whether there is one spirit manifesting in various ways in the nature, or every individual or every species has a spirit of its own; and whether it is an undimensional conscious entity influencing the dimensional relation, or it is also dimensional but not having the characteristics of matter-a very fine ethereal objective reality.\nThe issue has been dealt with by the various schools of thought in Islam by relying, more or less, on the theories of Greek, Indian and Persian philosophers. According to some commentators the answer is evasive because Allah says in this verse that the spirit is a matter of concern for Allah only and human knowledge is not sufficient to understand it. Some commentators say that the answer is there because as an outcome of Allah's command spirit should be treated as created, and its nature is all-pervading like the nature of the divine command, assuming appropriate form and character in every stage and every realm, sometimes dimensional and sometimes undimensional. In other words the spirit, the active agent in the universe and in the order of creation, is the outcome of the divine will, not conditioned by any particular character or limitation, like the radiation coming from its source, which is not conditioned at all by the character of the ground on which it falls, but the reflection or the effect produced by the radiation is conditioned by the character of the ground, material or non-material. It is from this viewpoint the spirit has been termed by the scholars as material or non-material.\nWhat proceeds from Allah is undimensional and non-material, which, when produces effect in material beings, becomes material; and, when produces effect in non-material realm, becomes non-material. The factor responsible for animal function is termed \"spirit\", and the mind itself is termed \"spirit\" because it produces effects and reflections known as knowledge; and what proceeds from Allah to give knowledge and awareness to human mind is also \"spirit\". Any effect or reflection produced by the agencies other than material factors, can be termed as spirit, or angels, or the hand of Allah. This is the interpretation of this verse in view of the traditions narrated from the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt. Human knowledge is not sufficient to understand the true nature of \"spirit\".\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 18:1]\nThe Quran, revealed to the Holy Prophet, contains plain, simple and clear guidance to mankind, in order that the Holy Prophet as the nadhir may warn those who do not believe in his message although it is straight and there is no ambiguity in it; and as the bashir may give glad tidings to those who believe and follow him.\nThe last verse of the preceding surah says that praise be to Allah because He has begotten no son and has no partner in His authority, and this surah also begins with \"praise be to Allah\" and states that those who say: \"Allah has begotten a son\" are like the disbelievers. The Jews, the Christians and the infidels are warned of a terrible punishment. The ultimate fate of a large number of human beings because of their obstinate adherence to falsehood caused utmost grief to the Holy Prophet, the mercy unto the worlds, who suffered abuse and persecution in order to preach the truth and show the way of salvation to the whole mankind, in every age, so that the maximum number of people may be saved from the certain wrath of Allah. His love for the human race was particular as well as general. It was his earnest desire that every living being should receive guidance from the book of Allah (the word hadith has been used for the Quran in verse 6) and follow its guidance to attain bliss and salvation.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 18:7]\nThe forests, the mountains, the rivers, the oceans, the valleys and all other natural resources created by Allah are useful for man, but He has placed the human beings on the earth amid these bounties so that He may try them to see which of them is best in deeds. Those who scramble for these bounties as if they shall have them for ever must know that one day the earth will become dust and waste, bare and barren. Refer to the commentary of Yunus: 10 and Hud: (9 to 22) Imam Jafar bin Muhammad As Sadiq said:\n\"In order to test the Holy Prophet the pagans of Makka sent three men to Najran so that they might learn a few unknown episodes from the Jew scholars and confront him with them. They returned with the story of the \"seven sleepers in the cave\", and when the Holy Prophet was asked to narrate their story these verses were revealed .\"\nThe Quran, as usual, lays stress on the moral lessons of the story, and not on the exact identification of the persons concerned. The Holy Prophet not only told them the main story but pointed out the variations that were current, and admonished them for disputing about such details. The story is treated as a parable, containing spiritual lessons of the highest value. The ashab ul kahf (the dwellers of the cave) were seven young Christian men who lived in Ephesus, a city on the west coast of Asia Minor. They lived in a society which was completely idolatrous, although they themselves were believers in only one God, as the true followers of Prophet Isa. The city in which they lived was under the rule of the Roman emperor Decius who ruled from 249 to 251 A.D. Decius was a tyrant, and an idol-worshipper. All those who lived under his rule were forced to worship the idols. He issued an order saying that any citizen who refused to worship the idols was a traitor and was condemned to death. Soon the seven young men-the ashab ul kahf-realised that they were the only persons left who refrained from worshipping the idols. This forced them to re-evaluate their situation: either give in to the majority pressure to worship idols, or refuse and be killed. None of these alternatives seemed favourable. Man must not jeopardise his life but should take all precautions to save it because it is a trust, and then leave the matter to the will of Allah. Therefore, they decided to leave the city and seek refuge elsewhere, away from the reach of the tyrant emperor. So they left the city. Outside the city, a dog named Qatmir joined them. They went towards the hills and finally found a cave for themselves. They prayed for Allah's help, and Allah made them sleep for about 300 years. A party of investigators, headed by a minister of the emperor came to the cave. The minister, who went inside the cave and found them sleeping, was a believer, so he told the emperor that they were dead. The cave was closed and a tablet (raqim) whereon were inscribed the names of the ashab ul kahf, their religion, and what it was from which they fled was put upon the entrance of the cave. The cave is said to be in Damascus. Even today the pilgrims who call upon the shrine of Bibi Zaynab, pay a visit to this cave.\nThey were raised up in the reign of Theodosius 11 (408 to 450 A.D.), who was a Christian. It is written in Hastings \"Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics\" that the cave was reopened when Allah suggested to Adolius, the proprietor of the field where the cave is, to build a sheepfold for his flock; for this purpose the workmen used the stones which closed the entrance of the cave. The long period of 300 years seemed to the ashab ul kahf, as if only a day or two passed by, or even less. So our ideas of time are fallacious. The Almighty Lord controls time and space. Even an animal who associated itself with the godly servants of Allah was rewarded. This event is an example of Allah's power to resurrect all human beings after their death on the day of judgement.\nThere is another version in which it is stated that when the ashab ul kahf came out of sleep they found the mouth of the cave closed.\nOne of them said:\n\"O my Lord, once I hired a man to work for me for one full day, but he finished the work in half a day and left without taking the payment. With the amount payable to him I bought a calf. Soon it multiplied into a herd. It so happened that one day he came to see me. I told him what had happened. He did not believe. I swore in Your name and gave the whole flock to him. I did it in Your name and for Your sake. Please open the cave.\"\nOne third portion of the cave opened. Another from them said:\n\"O my Lord, a beautiful woman came to me for some food when there was a widespread famine in our land. I desired her very much as soon as I saw her beauty but she refused to yield to my carnal passion and went away. She came to me again and again but every time I put the same proposal to her. At last she agreed. When I held her in my arms I felt she was violently trembling. To my question she said she was trembling in fear of God. I at once freed her and gave her the provision she asked for. I did it to obtain Your pleasure. I wept and sought Your forgiveness. Now I beseech You to open the cave.\"\nNow the two third portion of the cave was open. Another from them said:\n\"O my Lord, once I brought some milk for my parents, but found them asleep. I did not want to disturb them. So I waited beside them. The whole night passed and my flock of sheep perished in the field as I could not attend to them. In the morning my parents awoke and drank the milk. I did it to please You, O my l.ord; so open the cave.\"\nNow the whole cave lay open before them.\nWhatever is stated about the ashab ul kahf is a miracle of Allah. He is able to do all things. No one has yet found the bodies of ashab ul kahf who are said to be still sleeping. Allah has kept them invisible as He has kept Isa, Khizr, Idris and the living Imam Al Qa-im hidden from the sight of all people.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nWhen the people of the town found one of the ashab ul kahf in the market who went there to buy food they wanted to know who he was. He told them their story. They went with him to the cave. The man went inside in advance and informed his comrades that the emperor with his scholars is coming to see them. They fell prostrate before Allah and prayed that the sleep might come over them again. So when the royal entourage came in they were asleep. They decided to build a masjid over them. The act of giving recognition to the men of God has been appreciated by the Quran. To build a masjid over the graves of men of God or to treat the place where they are buried as a place of worship of Allah is permissible according to verse 21. On this basis the tawaf of hajr of Ismail, known as hajr al aswad, close to the Ka-bah, is obligatory during the performance of hajj.\nAccording to a few schools of thought in Islam the Holy Prophet issued orders contrary to the implication of this verse. They quote the following traditions:\n(i) Allah has cursed the Jews and the Christians for adopting the graves of their prophets as masjids (place of worship). Do not make my grave a place of worship.\n(ii) The Christians have chosen the place where their saints are buried as objects of worship. You should not do as they do.\n(iii) Do not glorify me as the Christians glorify Isa.\nEven if these traditions are authentic, they do not in any way repeal the permissibility of worshipping Allah near or on the grave of a chosen servant of Allah. They only warn the people not to treat the servants of Allah like the Lord to whom they had submitted unconditionally in their lives. The place where a chosen servant of Allah is buried becomes a sacred place which makes the worshipper of Allah remember Allah in a more favourable and spiritual environment than anywhere else. There is no restriction on the devotees of Allah to avoid any blessed place for His worship. In order to save the Muslims from falling into the pit of shirk (polytheism), it has been made obligatory to recite tashahud in every salat. There is no god save Allah and Muhammad is His servant and His messenger, and blessings of Allah be on Muhammad and his Ahl ul Bayt. There is no possibility of adopting any created being as an object of worship, beside Allah, when a Muslim repeats tashahud in every salat, which makes it clear that even the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, inspire of their highest status, are created beings, therefore there is none equal to Him and He alone is the sole object of worship. The Quran gives permission to remember the chosen servants of Allah as sincere worshippers of Allah. To pay homage to them, bowing and prostrating before them, as the angels were commanded to prostrate before Adam (Baqarah: 34) or the family of Yusuf prostrated before him (Yusuf: 100), is not prohibited, because worship (ibadat) depends on intention, and the intention of a true Muslim can never be their worship which is for Allah alone.\n"

Qummi says in his commentary that this verse was revealed when A-inya bin Hasin asked the Holy Prophet to send away Salman whenever he or wealthy people like him came to see him because the social status of a poor man like Salman who had only one garment did not justify his presence among them. The Holy Prophet recited this verse and added: \"Salman is one of my Ahl ul Bayt.\" It was a distinction which no other companion had ever enjoyed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Holy Prophet, who only followed the revelations (Najm: 4), never paid any attention to the loose talk of those who have been referred to in this verse, in Al Qalam: 10 to 15 and in the early verses of al Ahzab.\nThe qualities described in this verse refer to the ulil amr whose obedience has been made obligatory.

All this wealth made him very arrogant and proud. The other had nothing. His trust was in Allah. The worldly wealth of the first was destroyed because he had forgotten Allah who gave him the physical strength and intelligence to exploit the land and animals for his own advantage. The second was happier in the end because he believed that Allah was his Lord, and did not associate any one with his Lord. It was not wealth that ruined the wealthy man, but the attitude of his mind. In his love of the material possessions he forgot the spiritual share and openly defied the bestower of all bounties. The poor man remonstrates against the proud man who denied Allah. From his own spiritual experience he tells the proud man that Allah is good and the better way of enjoying His bounties is to remember Him and give thanks to Him. He warns him of the fleeting nature of worldly possessions and of the certainty of Allah's punishment for inordinate vanity.\nMan should always safeguard himself against the arrogance he builds up within his conscious soul when he enjoys prosperity and authority over less fortunate fellow-beings, because what the Almighty Lord has given him can be taken away from him in a flash of an eyelid. Those who safeguard themselves against evil with full awareness of the laws made by Allah never yield to the lure of wealth, pomp and power. They shall abide in the land of eternal bliss for ever. Those who surrender to evil, wickedness and pride shall have nothing but torment of the fire, after the day of judgement, for ever and ever.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 18:60]\nIn these verses the Quran describes the meeting which took place between Musa and a chosen servant of Allah, whose name, as per Islamic traditions, was Khizr. Allah told Musa that if he wanted to see a more knowledgeable person then he should go to meet him at the place where the two seas come together. The sign for that meeting-place was that a fish would disappear in the water.\nMusa was the most learned man of his times, but even his wisdom did not comprehend everything. Therefore he was commanded by Allah to go in search of Khizr who would impart to him such knowledge as even he did not possess.\nTo meet him Musa had to reach the junction of the two seas where he lived. The distance was very long. Huquba means a long space of time, sometimes it is limited to 80 years. Musa took Yusha, his attendant, with him. When they reached the junction of the two seas where the two arms of the Red Sea join together viz., the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of Suez, they stopped and took rest. Yusha put the cooked fish on a nearby rock. While Yusha was looking on, the fish took its way into the sea in a strange manner. When they had passed the meeting-place, Musa felt hungry and asked Yusha to bring the fish. Then Yusha cursed the avowed enemy of man, Shaytan, who made him forget the mentioning of it to Musa. So they immediately turned back retracing their tracks and reached the meeting place where they found Khizr, a servant from among the servants of Allah, whom He had granted mercy and whom He had taught knowledge from Himself. Verses 66 to 77 describe the actions of Khizr, during their onward journey, which baffled Musa and forced him to question Khizr inspite of the warning Khizr gave to him in the beginning that he would not be able to bear patiently with the events he could not comprehend. In verses 79 to 82 Khizr explains to Musa the interpretation of his actions which he could not bear with patience.\nMusa learned from Khizr that the mysteries of life are diverse and countless. The finite mind cannot easily disentangle the web of secrets unless the all-wise Lord shows the way to have a glimpse of the unknown; that patience is essential to face the vicissitudes of life and to know the inner meanings of the external manifestations; that the working of the divine plan always brings good in the end; that in the larger interest of the human society the loss of a few lives is not a loss at all; and that good deeds should be done for the sake of good not for immediate return in terms of material gain.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn verse 79 Khizr says: \"I intended to damage it (the boat)\"; in verse 81 he says: \"We intended that their Lord would give them in exchange (a son) better in purity\"; and in verse 82 he says: \"So your Lord intended that they should attain their maturity.\" In the end he says: \"I did it not of my own accord.\"\nThe reason for taking the responsibility of damaging the boat in verse 79, is not to attribute such an act to Allah as a matter of courtesy. In verse 81 the slaying of the boy deprived him of his life but it was a service to his parents, therefore \"we\" is used. The deprivation refers to Khizr and the advantage refers to Allah. The act referred to in verse 82 is purely good, so it has been attributed to Allah exclusively. Khizr's statement is based upon the fact that every manifestation has a cause in the final analysis. In verse 79 he refers to himself as the causative agent; in verse 81 he takes the apparent and the real causes into consideration; and in verse 82 by stating that \"he did not do anything\" he discards human or any created agency and points towards the real author of all events. Whatever takes place is a divine blessing in disguise even if the manifestation is apparently not favourable to an individual or a group of individuals. The knowledge of even those who have received divine revelation is not all-encompassing, and is limited according to the excellence Allah bestowed on them as mentioned in verse 253 al Baqarah and explained in the commentary of Bani Israil: 1.\n"

Whether Dhul Qarnayn was Alexander or Darius or some one else is not the issue in these verses but the Quran aims to provide guidance to man through the narrative of a man who possessed two qualities, knowledge and strength, like Talut. Dhul Qarnayn was an upright and righteous king, a true servant of Allah, whose sway extended over east and west, and over people of diverse civilisations. His first expedition was to the west. A spring of murky water refers to Lychintis (now Ochrida). There he protected the weak and punished the unlawful and the turbulent.\nHe possessed the qualities, a god-fearing man must own, to administer the affairs of men. Great was his power and great were his ways and means which he used for justice and righteousness, but he always remembered that his power and capabilities were given to him by Allah. He never said like Firawn: \"I am your Lord, most high.\" He declared that his punishment to the wicked was tentative to preserve the balance of this life as he could appraise it but the real consequences of the evil-doing will be encountered by the evildoers on the day of judgement.\nThen he went to the east. Those who lived there were a primitive but simple people. The climate was hot, and they required neither roofs over their heads, nor much clothing. He did not disturb their simple mode of living. He left them as they were. Dhul Qarnayn was a man of God. He was not a despot who would forcibly change that which he did not find agreeable to him. He knew his limitations in the sight of his Lord.\nThen he reached a tract between two mountains (most probably Armenia and Azerbaijan). The people of this land did not understand the speech of the conqueror. Dhul Qarnayn was now among a people who were different in speech and race from him. They were a peaceable and industrious race, much subject to incursions from wild tribes who were called Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog). Against these tribes they were willing to pay him tribute in return for protection. The permanent protection they wanted was the closing of a mountain gap through which the incursions were made. Dhul Qarnayn was not greedy. He did not impose any tribute, nor was he in need of monetary help or subsidy from them. He had the organising skill. He only asked for material and labour. A barrier was constructed with blocks or bricks of iron, and the cracks were filled up with molten lead, so as to form an impregnable mass of metal. After all the effort which he made for their protection, he claimed no credit for himself beyond that of discharging his duties as a ruler. He turned their attention to Allah who provided the ways and means by which they could be helped and protected, but a time would come when all their precautions would crumble into dust, because it was a promise of Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 19:2]\nRefer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 38 to 41 for the prayer of Zakariyya.\nZakariyya invoked Allah to give him a son, not only as the inheritor of his family but also as an upholder of his mission and the mission of his ancestors.\nIt is interesting to recall here that when the Holy Prophet passed away and Abu Bakr was made caliph to rule over the Muslim community he dispossessed the Holy Prophet's daughter Fatimah of the agricultural land or estate known as Fadak which had been gifted to her by the Holy Prophet during his life time and given in her possession. When Fatimah asked Abu Bakr to restore her estate as it had been gifted to her by the Holy Prophet along with possession, he demanded evidence and refused to accept the evidence of witnesses produced by Fatimah. Then she claimed the estate as the sole heir to her father, the Holy Prophet. This request was rejected by Abu Bakr saying that he had heard the Holy Prophet say that \"We the messengers of Allah neither inherit nor leave inheritance.\"\nIn the light of verses 5 and 6 the statement of Abu Bakr should be treated as an instantaneous excuse, he thought of, to deprive Bibi Fatimah from the lawful inheritance, her father left for her, otherwise the words of Allah become vague and meaningless. In reply she quoted these verses to prove that he had reported a false tradition because when the Quran has used the word \"warith\" the Holy Prophet could not say that which the caliph reported. The mention of these verses by her means that the word \"warith\" refers to all that which a messenger of Allah leaves as inheritance. She was the daughter of the Holy Prophet (tutored and educated by him from the day she was able to talk and understand) to whom the Quran was revealed, and she was the wife of Ali ibn abi Talib whose authority on the Quran stands established in view of several traditions mentioned on page 5-both of them only knew the hidden and the manifest meanings of every word of the Quran. Therefore her understanding of the Quran must be preferred over those who never had been credited with even a cursory knowledge of the book of Allah. Please refer to the commentary of Bani Israil: 26, Nahl . 90 and the Biography of Bibi Fatimah Zahra, published by our Trust, to know the full details pertaining to the issue of Fadak.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThese verses prove that the prophets of Allah inherit and leave inheritance. To interpret \"Warith\" as reference to knowledge and wisdom only is a deviation from the real, direct and plain meaning of this word, without any external or internal evidence. If inheritance of personal belongings is excluded, the repetition of the verb becomes meaningless because Zakariyya himself was a descendant of ali Yaqub, who inherited the prophethood and wisdom of his ancestors, and his son would do the same if Allah so willed as He chooses whomsoever He wills as His messenger (An-am: 124), therefore Zakariyya said: \"inherit me and inherit ali Yaqub\". Zakariyya is referring to his belongings and the belongings of the posterity of Yaqub separately. The first verb refers to the inheritance of his property which Zakariyya thought would be appropriated by his relatives if he remained childless; and the second verb refers to the prophethood, he wanted for Yahya, for which there was no need to fear that it would be taken by any one. Verse 16 of An Nahl confirms that which has been explained here.\nNo doubt the prophets of Allah did not give any importance to the material possessions and laid emphasis on the knowledge and wisdom, but it does not mean that they did not possess property or did not leave what they had as inheritance to their next to kin. The tradition quoted to deprive Bibi Fatimah of her lawful inheritance was tampered with by the narrator for political reasons. He omitted a clause indicating that they leave knowledge as inheritance, and added a clause, which is not correct from the grammatical point of view, unless it is an objective clause subordinate to the principal clause \"We the group of prophets\", and the word be read as \"sadaqtan\", the second object to the verb \"taraknahu \", but he read the clause as co-ordinative and conjunctive, and read \"sadaqtan\" as the predicate to the word \"ma\", which according to the recitation means \"whatever\", whereas according to the correct recitation \"ma \" means \"that which\".\nThe mother of the son given to Zakariyya was a born barren woman, so he was named Yahya, derived from hayat (life), a name which was given to him for the first time. The Hebrew form of Yahya is Johanan which means \"Jehvah (God) has been gracious\". Hananan (see verse 13) means compassion.\nThe births of Isa and Yahya were the miraculous signs of the will of Allah. Isa was born to a virgin without a father and Yahya was born to a born barren woman, and both of them were so disinterested in the physical life that they never married.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAccording to the Ahl ul Bayt, the names of Muhammad, Ali, Hasan and Husayn were also chosen for the first time under divine inspiration.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq said:\n\"Before Yahya and Husayn, no one was ever named by either of their names.\nFor no one the heavens wept for forty days save Yahya and Husayn.\nThe murderers of Yahya and Husayn were illegitimate. The heads of both of them were severed from their bodies and displayed in the streets and the courts which (according to Imam Husayn) prove the worthlessness of this world in the estimation of Allah. The head of Yahya was presented before the depraved wife of the Egyptian king and her pervert daughter and the head of Husayn was presented to the sons of whores.\")\n(\"The heavens wept\" means the sun became extraordinarily red according to the Imam).\nIt was as easy for Allah to give a son to a born barren woman from an old and decrepit man as He brought them into being when they were nothing.\nAwha, the root of which is wahi, is used in verse 11 to indicate communication by signs.\nVerse 12 says that hukm (strength, power of judgement and prophethood) was given to Yahya in his childhood. Likewise Isa was also appointed as the prophet of Allah while he was in the cradle. Therefore there is no justification for the misconceived idea propagated by a large number of Muslims that the Holy Prophet was an illiterate person (see commentary of al Baqarah: 97).\nAyyashi quotes Ali bin Asbath as under:\n\"While going to Egypt I met Imam Ali bin Musa in Madina. Then he was a five year old boy. I was greatly impressed by his knowledge when we talked about on various topics. I had decided to tell everyone in Egypt about his extraordinary wisdom and judgement. As soon as the idea came into my mind, he recited: 'We gave him (Yahya) wisdom, while yet a child.'\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn dawat dhil ashirah Ali ibn abi Talib was the only person who came forward in response to the call of the Holy Prophet:\n\"Who among you will help me and join me in my task, and be my brother, my lieutenant, my vicegerent and my successor?\"\nSo then and there the Holy Prophet declared: \"Verily Ali is my brother, my vicegerent and my successor. From this day it has been made obligatory upon every one to obey the superior authority of Ali.\" Please refer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 52 and 53. In view of this verse and verse 46 of Ali Imran no sincere Muslim is in a position to bypass the vicegerency of Ali on the ground that he was at the time a very young boy. Likewise the imamah and wilayah of Imam Muhammad bin Ali at Taqi and Imam Muhammad bin Hasan al Qa-im cannot be disputed on account of their age in presence of these verses in the Quran.\nRefer to verse 1 to 4 of Ar Rahman to know that Allah Himself taught wisdom to the Holy Prophet because of which the word ummi has been used in the Quran (refer to the commentary of al Baqarah : 97.\nYahya boldly denounced sin. He had pity and love for all creatures of Allah, lived among the humble and lonely, despised worldly comforts, and never used violence nor entertained a spirit of rebellion against human or divine law.\nHe did not live long. He was beheaded by Herod, the provincial ruler under the Roman empire, at the instigation of the woman with whom Herod was infatuated. For full details of Yahya's life refer to our publication \"The Glimpses of the Prophets\" based upon the well-known book \"Hayatul ul Qulub\" by Allama Majlisi.\nPeace and Allah's blessings were on him when he was born; they continued when he was about to die an unjust death at the hands of a tyrant; and they will be manifest at the day of resurrection.\n"

They say that the spirit appeared before Maryam in her vision; and on this basis deny the physical ascension (mi-raj) of the Holy Prophet.

Generally any female belonging to a family is described as a sister or daughter of the head of the family. The Quran and the Bible assert that Maryam and Zakariyya's wife were the descendants of Harun, the brother of Musa, a prophet of God, and through him belonged to the tribe of Levi, noted for virtue and piety, and not to the house of Dawud. In order to remove the discrepancies between the two genealogies, given in Matthew and Luke, the Christian Church wrongly tries to establish that one refers to Maryam and the other refers to Joseph, the alleged husband of Maryam, which is entirely based upon conjecture and is against the clear wordings of the Quran and the Bible.\nWhen Isa was born the people of the town declared that Maryam had fallen and disgraced the name of her progenitors.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 19:29] (see commentary for verse 16)As stated in the commentary of verse 26 the child in the cradle, Isa, was selected by Allah to give the answer. This verse and verse 46 of Ali Imran clearly say that Isa, lying in the cradle, spoke clearly to defend his holy mother. It is downright mischief-making based upon meaningless interpretation to say, as the commentator of a man-made religion tries to argue, that Isa declared his prophethood in his advanced age and not from the cradle while he was yet an infant. The people questioned Maryam about her giving birth to a child without a husband as soon as Isa was born, not when he grew up and attained maturity.\nIn verse 26 she was asked not to give her own answers, therefore when she brought him to them and was reprimanded, she pointed to the baby in the cradle as stated in verse 27, 28 and 29. That this event took place immediately after the birth of Isa is also confirmed by verse 29 since the people asked as to how they could talk to one who was a child in the cradle. It would be sheer nonsense if they had spoken these words when Isa was a grown up man.\nWhen the self-interest oriented people do not find the exalted excellence the chosen servants of Allah possess in their favourite leaders whom they themselves choose to lay hands on worldly possessions, they have no alternative but to deny the possibility of such excellence altogether. They twist the appropriate meanings of the verses of the Quran and introduced remote and obscure inferences to confuse the people in order to put forward their conjecture and false theories. As mentioned in Baqarah: 117; Ali Imran: 40; Nahl: 40; Bani Israil: 35 and Ya Sin: 28 the will of Allah takes immediate effect without any time gap. His will is independent of any causative factor, nor is it necessary for Allah even to say the word \"Be\", because as soon as His will activates that which it wills comes into being or takes place with or without a causative effect at once without a delay in terms of time or space.\nFrom the cradle Isa says: \"Allah has given me a book (Injil) and made me a prophet.\" Compare the Quran's declaration that Isa was a prophet of Allah from the day he was born and the Injil was revealed to him simultaneously with the opinions of the majority of Muslim scholars and their followers about the Holy Prophet mentioned in the commentary of verse 12 of this surah and al Baqarah: 97.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"I was a prophet of Allah when Adam was yet in the making.\"\nLike Isa Ali ibn abi Talib was also a believer in Allah from the day he was born in Ka-bah, and was the first person to believe in the prophethood of the Holy Prophet, and never worshipped a ghayrallah. Refer to the commentary al Baqarah: 124; Ali Imran: 52 and 53 and Bara-at: 100.\nIn verse 30 Isa declares at the very outset that he is a servant of Allah, thus negating the false notion that he was God or the son of God. Refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 255 and Ali Imran: 2 and 3.

The Ismaelite branch, his latest generation, began with the Holy Prophet and continued through Ali ibn abi Talib upto Imam Mahdi al Qa-im. See commentary of al Baqarah: 124.

There is no difference between these two alternatives because he was not only ali by his name but also, in all aspects of his personality, he was ali in the real sense of the adjective. He was created ali by the aliyyul ala, the highest high, the Lord of the worlds. As the gate to the city of knowledge (the Holy prophet) he was the \"truthful tongue\" of all the previous prophets of Allah, because whoever represents the Holy Prophet represents all the prophets of Allah. Therefore he is rightly known as the kitabullah al natiq, the speaking book of Allah.\n"

Likewise Ali was appointed as the successor of the Holy Prophet at the time of his ascension (see commentary of Bani Israil: 1). Ali was not a prophet because prophethood terminated in the Holy Prophet as the religion of Allah was completed on the day of Ghadir when the Holy Prophet, under the command of Allah, established the wilayah and imamah of Ali ibn abi Talib, so there was no need of any prophet after the Holy Prophet (see commentary of Fatihah: 7).

Verse 32 of al Fatir refers to these believers as those chosen persons who were foremost in good deeds upon whom Allah had bestowed His highest grace.\nThe word unseen (gayb) in verse 61 suggests that the pleasures of paradise or hardships of hell, mentioned in the Quran, are not like the pleasures and pains of the world. It is a figurative description to give a general idea to man whose senses are not able to perceive the true state of affairs in the life of hereafter. For this very reason the phrase \"morning and evening\" has been used in relative sense in verse 62, so as to be comprehended by us, as there will be no actual sunset in paradise.\nAlso refer to Yunus: 10, Ibrahim: 23 and Waqi-ah: 26 for \"salutations of peace\" mentioned in verse 62.\n"

He married the daughter of the prophet Shu-ayb, and was now travelling with his family. The night was cool in the open desert. He saw a fire and went to bring an ember from it for his wife and two sons. When he approached it Allah called him \"O Musa\" in order to give him heart and confidence, and announced: \"I am your Lord, so take off your shoes.\" Tuwa literally means \"a thing twice done\", or \"twice blessed\". As a proper noun it is the name of the valley below mount Sinai. The command \"to take off the shoes\" is interpreted as a mark of humility for self and respect for Allah, or to renounce the thought of family, so as to be present before the Lord in utter devotedness and concentration of heart and mind. According to almost all the Sunni commentators the renunciation of self and family implied in this verse is tabarra, enacted as an article of faith by Shi-ahs.\nExodus 3: 2 to 5 also relates this event.\nMusa was chosen as a prophet and a messenger of Allah to whom Tawrat was revealed. He was commanded to worship Allah alone, because there is no god save He, and establish prayer (salat) for His remembrance. It was made clear to him that the hour of reckoning would certainly come to pass, but its exact time was kept hidden in order that every individual may be recompensed according to that which he or she has strived for in this world. \"No one who carries a burden shall bear the burden of another\" says verse 15 of Bani Israil.\nIt must be noted that throughout the Quran mostly address has been made to al nas, the people, through the prophets or messengers, because the prophets were sent to the people who are accountable for their deeds. Therefore it was not Musa but the people who are commanded not to be misled by those who follow their own vain desires and lusts in verse 16.\nThen the miracle of the transformation of the rod, Musa used to carry with him, into a serpent was shown to Musa by Allah. The second miracle given to him was the \"white and shining hand\". His hand was glorified, and it shone as with a divine light. Refer to Exodus 4: 1 to 9 for the above-noted miracles.\nMusa, having been prepared, was commanded to go to Firawn, Rameses II, who had transgressed all bounds. Then Musa requested his Lord to appoint for him another person like him to strengthen his back and assist him in his task. Refer to the commentary of Maryam: 53 and Ali Imran: 52 and 53 for parallelism between Musa and Harun and Muhammad and Ali. The task before the Holy Prophet was much more difficult and hazardous. Musa had to face one Firawn but the Holy Prophet had to deal with a great many Firawns; every tribal chief of the Quraysh was more dangerous than the Firawn of Musa. Musa asked for Harun and the Holy Prophet asked for Ali. Allah accepted the prayers of both of them.\nRefer to Exodus 4: 10, 13 to 16 for the appointment of Harun as the spokesman of Musa by the Lord.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"O Ali, you are to me as Harun was to Musa, but there is no prophethood after me.\"\n(Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 51 and Maryam: 53).\nThe following is a traditionally transmitted invocation by the Holy Prophet:\n\"O Allah, my brother Musa begged You saying: 'O my Lord, delight my heart and make my task easy and undo the knot in my tongue so that they may understand my talk and appoint from among my kinsmen Harun, my brother, as my wazir and strengthen my back with him and make him participate in my mission.' You inspired him: 'We shall soon strengthen your arm with your brother and make you both dominant.' O Allah, I am Your servant and Your messenger Muhammad. I beg You to delight my heart and make my task easy and appoint from among my kinsmen Ali, my brother, as my wazir.\"\nIt is reported that in response to this prayer verse 55 of al Ma-idah was revealed. Refer to its commentary.\nAbu Is-haq al Thalabi has recorded the above prayer in his Tafsir Kabir while commenting on the verse occurring in al Ma-idah. Al Balakhi in his Yanabi has copied the same version from Ahmad bin Hanbal's Musnad.\nPlease also refer to verses 1 to 6 of al Inshirah which make it known that the Holy Prophet's prayer was accepted by Allah, and in verse 7 He commands the Holy Prophet to establish his successorship.\nPlease refer to the commentary of al Baqarah 52 and 53 to know that the Holy Prophet had appointed Ali as his successor on the first day he made public his mission in the assembly of the \"near relatives\"; and refer to the commentary of al Ma-idah: 67 to know that the Holy Prophet, under the command of Allah, appointed Ali as the guardian, master and commander of all believing men and believing women, as his successor.\nIn verse 38 awhayna means \"We inspired\". When Firawn was told by his courtiers that a boy would soon be born to an Israelite woman who would cause his downfall and destroy his kingdom, he ordered Israelite male children to be killed when they were born. So, as soon as Musa was born, Allah inspired his mother to put her child into a chest and send the chest floating down the Nile. It flowed on into a stream that passed through Firawn's garden. It was picked up by Firawn's wife Asiya. Firawn was an enemy to Allah and an enemy to Musa, but Allah made Musa so comely, attractive and loveable as to be adopted by Firawn and Asiya. Refer to Exodus 2 : 3 to 9 for these events.\nAfter the child was floated on the water, the anxious mother sent Musa's sister to follow the chest from the bank and see where and by whom it was picked up. When it was picked by Firawn's family and they seemed to love the child, she appeared before them and promised to bring a good wet-nurse for the child. That was exactly what they wanted. Like that Allah's providence looked after Musa in bringing his mother to him, and nourishing him on his mother's milk, and thus the mother's heart was also comforted.\nYears passed. Musa grew up. He saw the Egyptian oppression under which the Bani Israel laboured. One day He saw an Egyptian smiting an Israelite with impunity. There and then, he smote the Egyptian. He did not intend to kill him, but the Egyptian died of his blow. After this Musa went to the Sinai peninsula and married the daughter of prophet Shu-ayb. After many years spent in grazing his father-in-laws' flocks, one day he came to the valley of Tuwa and the incident of fire took place. He was addressed by Allah and was chosen to be His messenger. He was granted his request that his brother should be his wazir. Then Allah commanded them both to go to Firawn because he had transgressed all bounds.\n\"Speak to him a gentle word (mildly), haply he may take warning or fear (Allah)\" is an everlasting lesson for mankind that before taking the final step to correct even a transgressor like Firawn kind exhortation in soft spoken words is the best course.\nIn the first place their mission was to preach the word of Allah to Firawn and the Egyptians so that they might be shown the right path (Allah, in His infinite mercy, always offers peace even to the most hardened sinners) and then stop the oppression inflicted upon the Bani Israil.\nFirawn refused to accept the Lord of Musa and Harun (who gave to each created thing its form and nature, and further gave it guidance) as his Lord because he preferred the idols worshipped by his ancestors. Musa enumerated all the bounties of the beneficent Lord given to man in this world, but Firawn belied them and refused to believe even when the signs (the miracles of transformation of the rod into a serpent and his \"white shining hand\") were shown to him.\nPlease refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 49 and 50, 57, 63; Araf: 103 to 137,160 and Yunus : 75 to 92 for the miracle of the rod and the magicians, the children of Israil, crossing the sea; making of a covenant on mount Sinai and commentary of Hud: 96 to 99.\nWhen Umer bin Abdawud, a Firawn of his times, at the time of the battle of Khandaq, challenged the Holy Prophet to send some one from the party of his \"God\" as an answer to his might, the Holy Prophet sent Ali as the sign of Allah to overcome the arrogant infidel. See commentary of al Baqarah: 214 and 251.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAli ibn abi Talib says in Nahj al Balagha that the fear mentioned in verse 67 felt by Musa was not the fear of the serpents, nor was Musa afraid of the harm that could occur to him but he was apprehensive of the possible confusion that could mislead the people. Verses 70 and 71 indicate that miracles are real whereas sorcery is unreal and lasts a few moments only.\nThe sinners will abide in hell for ever. They will in vain desire cessation of consciousness to escape the unending and unbearable torment, but there will be no release from the conscious \"living through\" of the torture. Escape from existence will not be possible, and living will be worse than loss of life.\nThe life in paradise will be a continuous conscious existence amid bliss and grace provided by the Lord of the worlds. Allah forgives the sinners again and again if they repent, believe and make amends and do good deeds. In contrast to this condition of earning divine forgiveness which generates good, peace and harmony among the people, there is the Christian theory of unconditional redemption of all sinners by prophet Isa when he paid the price of all sins committed and to be committed by all the human beings. Instead of putting an end to evil and sin this theory gives licence to people to spread corruption in the world as and when they deem necessary to fulfil their selfish desires.\n"

By Allah, if a man worships Allah all his life between the holy Ka-bah and the maqam of Ibrahim without remaining attached to us, Allah will throw him headlong in the hell when he dies.\nthe grant of manna wa salwa. Also refer to the Hakim has mentioned the above narration as a tradition through his own chain-of narrators; and Ayyashi has also mentioned it through several chains of narrators.\nThe Holy Prophet, therefore, declared through hadith al thaqalayn (see page 6) that the word of Allah, the Quran (His guidance, mercy and wisdom), can neither be understood nor put into practice unless the Muslims refer to Ahl ul Bayt and follow their teachings. To love them or to remain attached with them has been commanded in verse 23 of Shura.\nWhen Musa was summoned to the mount for forty days (Baqarah: 51), he left Harun behind him as his representative among the people. Similarly the Holy Prophet left Ali as his vicegerent and executor of his will when he migrated from Makka to Madina, and also when he went on the expedition of Tabuk. See commentary of Baqarah; 51 and 207; Anfal: 30; and Bara-at: 41 and 42.\nWhile Musa was on the mount his people were tested and tried, and they failed in the trial. The Israelites had brought from Egypt jewels of gold and silver and raiments. Samiri, an Egyptianised Hebrew, who came with them, made a golden calf from the said ornaments. All of them began to worship the image of the calf which made a hollow sound (see commentary of Araf: 148). Harun admonished them and made every effort to keep them from worshipping a meaningless and lifeless object which had no power either to harm them or to do them good. He warned them that they were being tested by their Lord. They did not listen to him.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe questions Musa asks in verses 92 and 93 and the reply Harun gives in verse 94 are used as a medium to make the position of Harun clear by making known the fact to the people that Harun prevented them from falling a prey to Samiri's guile and discharged his duty of guiding them to the right path. He did not want to cause a division among the children of Israil.\nSamiri's answer is an example of mixing truth with falsehood. He says that he took a handful of dust from the footprint of the angel Jibra-il and threw it into the calf's image.\nLike Musa the Holy Prophet also left Ali as his successor among the people, and the Samiries among the Muslims made their own images of authorities by distorting and discarding the word of Allah and the word of the Holy Prophet. On the day of judgement all Samiries shall be afflicted with the wrath of Allah.\n \nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAll infringements in the unity of a religion are made by mixing half truth; with imposture. It played a very important role in the development of various sects in Islam.\n \n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 20:115]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAdam was advised not to approach the tree if he wanted to live in the blissfulness he was in, otherwise he would have to leave it and go into the world to face its hardship and its tests and trials. Adam apparently chose the life of the world. See commentary of Baqarah: 30 to 38; Araf: 11 to 25; Hijr: 28 to 42; Bani Israil: 61 to 65 and Kahf : 50.\nAll his needs and comforts had been provided for in the life of bliss Adam and Hawwa were living in, but there is no mention of the heavenly bliss (the nearness and the pleasure of Allah) described as the greatest enjoyment in verse 15 of Ali Imran and verse 72 of Bara-at. Shaytan had no idea of such a place. He only saw the comforts of the place Adam was inhabiting and, out of spite and vengeance, decided to take him out from there and throw him in the land of test and trial, toil and hardship. Those who fail to understand the story of Adam should study the following facts to have a clear view:\nAdam and his progeny were sent in this world to fulfil the covenant they made with Allah. For those who followed the guidance sent down by Allah it was a blessing.\nAdam was created to represent Allah on the earth as His vicegerent (Baqarah: 30). His stay in the place of bliss (not the paradise) was temporary. Adam was not a weak-willed being who even was not able to control himself when Shaytan lured him through his wife. Certainly Allah would not choose such a weakling as His vicegerent whom the angels had to accept as their superior (Baqarah: 31 and 32). Allah has created man in the best mould (Tin: 4), and on account of this superiority He commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam (Baqarah: 34).\nIbrahim was chosen as an Imam for the whole mankind when he passed the test (Baqarah: 124). Adam established his superiority over the angels when he displayed the knowledge of the names Allah taught to him (Baqarah: 31). Adam also passed the test. Therefore the behaviour of Adam should be understood in the light of the test after completion of which he was appointed as the vicegerent of Allah. Verses 40 and 42 of Hijr; 65 of Bani Israil; 51 of Maryam and 33 of Ahzab assert that Shaytan has no authority over those servants of Allah who have been freed from the taint of evil and purified; and Adam was one of them, so there was no question of Shaytan misleading Adam after he was selected as the vicegerent of Allah. As Imam Ali bin Musa ar Ridha has pointed out these events (of test and trial) took place in the place of bliss where Adam was not yet aware of the names, therefore was not yet chosen as the vicegerent of Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 20:132]\nThe first, foremost and unavoidable duty of a true believer is to worship Allah regularly and punctually through the five daily obligatory prayers. Salat is not a \"stereotyped force of the habit\" ritual. It is the truest outward expression of truthful hearts and intelligent minds. It is because of this physical show of obedience unto Allah by His \"created\" servants (willing to submit to His will and laws, accepting total dependence on Him, worshipping Him alone, declaring to follow prophets and the Imams, appointed by Him undertaking to discard and avoid evil and evildoers) salat is accepted as the pivot, the pillar and the foundation of the true faith. Refer to Baqarah : 21, 43, 45; Nisa: 103, 142; An-am: 72; Taha: 14; Hud: 14; Ankabut: 45; Rum: 31; Hijr :99 and Muddaththir :42 and 43.\nThe five daily obligatory salats have to be prayed under all circumstances. If a man cannot stand on account of genuine reasons,, he or she must perform it in sitting posture, or lying down if it is not possible, even by signs in extreme disability, but at all costs salat has to be prayed. For exemptions see books of fiqh.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"The 'daily prayers schedule' is like a fountain of clean water right in your home which removes, five times a day, dirt that settles on your body and soul.\nBe firm, and steadily make your family members pray salat regularly.\nSalat will be the first item on the agenda of cross-examination on the day of judgement.\nA Muslim will be exposed to the danger of reverting to obstinate waywardness (kufr) if he wilfully or negligently fails to pray the salat. Whoso hears the \"call for prayers\" and leaves the premises of the masjid without praying the salat, with no inclination to come back, is a hypocrite munafiq).\nA faithful mumin) makes use of the salat as a ladder to reach the closest nearness of Allah miraj).\nSalat is the mainstay of the religion of Allah (Islam). Approval of the prayed salat is the precondition for the acceptance of good deeds done, otherwise its non-acceptance renders other deeds null and void.\nSalat is the chief constituent of (the theory of) worship.\nSalat wards off disasters.\nSalat opens the lock to let in (the prayer) into the (house of) eternal peace and happiness (paradise).\nImam Ali said:\nBeware! Pray salat regularly. To grow intimacy with Allah pray as much as possible.\nIf one knows how many blessings are bestowed upon the prayer during the time of praying the salat, one would not leave the prayer-mat at all.\nDispel the darkness of the doubtful heart by the light of prayers.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq said:\nWhoso gives no importance to salat and takes it lightly is not ours, therefore, he rightly will be deprived of our support.\nOnce a man comes into the fold of Islam through his own free will, he submits to the will of Allah and worships Him as has been told in the above noted verses and traditions.\nAt every call (adhan) he puts off worldly duties and willingly surrenders to the Almighty Allah because there is no god save Allah who takes care of His servant, gives him love, happiness and peace in this world and the hereafter.\nIn 61 Hijra, on the 10th Muharram, our beloved Imam Husayn bin Ali astride the \"Dul Jinnah\", was alone in the middle of the tightening circle of the blood-thirsty killers; swords, arrows, spears, daggers, lances, and stones hit him from all directions. Every pore of his holy body was a bleeding wound.\nIt was the time for Asr prayer.\nIn the midst of such impending danger he slid over the burning sand of Karbala and rested his forehead on the ground to prostrate himself in adoration of the Almighty Creator. The accursed Shimer came close and severed the sacred head of the Holy Imam from his blessed body. It was his last sajdah through which he preserved the salat for ever.\nNow whoso claims to be a true friend and follower of the holy Imam prays the salat regularly to worship the Almighty Allah and says:\n\"Verily my worship and my sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds.\"\n(An-Aam: 163)\n"

This repudiates the doctrines of maya and lila and their implications. If such an idea as that of play or pastime had been possible with regard to Allah, and if He had wished really to indulge in pastime, He would have done it with the things of real excellence near to Him, not with the lowly creation that we see around us.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nMan tries to perceive Allah in the light of his own thoughts, feelings and urges, therefore, he thinks that like him, Allah also takes pleasure in fun and frolic and created the creation for His amusement as the \"authorities\" in his society amuse themselves with women, children and other sensuous pleasures. If at all the purpose is amusement, what amuses Allah is quite different from that which amuses man. Verse 18 asserts the seriousness of the purpose.\nMimma tasifun (what you ascribe) refers to the false belief of associate-gods (Anbiya: 22), begotten son (Anbiya: 26) and Allah's daughters (Nahl: 57).\n"

Nothing is hidden from or unknown to Allah.\"\nImam Ali bin Husayn Zayn al Abidin said:\n\"Reckoning will be for the believers. The disbelievers will be punished outright according to the degree of their wickedness.\"\nIt is also reported that figuratively it means that the thoughts and deeds of a believer will be compared with the thoughts and deeds of the Prophet or the Imam of the age in which he or she lived.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 21:51]\nBefore Musa and Harun Allah bestowed rushd (guidance) on Ibrahim.\nDifferent aspects of Ibrahim's excellence have been mentioned in the following verses:\nAl Baqarah: 124 to 127, 130, 132, 135, 258 and 260.\nAli Imran: 67, 95, 97\nNisa: 125\nAn-am: 74 to 83\nBara-at: 113,114\nHud: 69 to 76\nIbrahim: 35 to 41\nHijr: 51 to 60\nNahl: 120 to 123\nMaryam : 41 to 50\nAnbiya: 51 to 73\nHajj: 26 to 29\nShu-ara: 69 to 89\nAnkabut: 16,17,24,31,32\nSaffat: 83 to 113\nDhariyat: 24 to 34\nMumtahinah: 4.\nWhen Allah bestowed rectitude or discerning ability (rushd ) on Ibrahim, he set his divine mission in motion and showed the right path to Azar, his uncle (see commentary of An-am: 75 and 77 to 84; and Maryam: 42 to 49), and his people. Although Azar brought him up and was like a father to him, Ibrahim stood against him and his people and boldly condemned their false gods. When his duty to his benefactor clashed with his duty to Allah, Ibrahim, as a true servant of Allah, upheld the truth and opposed the falsehood tooth and nail, for which he was subjected to the fire of persecution, but his firmness and devotion drew Allah's mercy, and the very painful affliction he was placed in became his joy and comfort. It is an everlasting lesson to mankind.\nIt was a day of festivity. The idolaters were rejoicing in the streets and open fields. Ibrahim broke all their idols to pieces but left the chief idol intact. When they came back and found their idols lying broken on the floor they brought Ibrahim on the scene and asked him if it was he who did that with their gods. Ibrahim pointed to the chief idol, left intact by him, and asked them to find out the truth from him. It is obvious that the question of lying or deceit on the part of Ibrahim rises nowhere in the whole episode. Ibrahim had the best of the argument. They knew the idols could not speak. They turned to each other and confessed their folly and hung their heads in shame. When they admitted that idols could not speak, Ibrahim put forward his decisive argument mentioned in verses 66 to 67 about the unity of Allah beside whom no one should be worshipped.\nNimrud ordered Ibrahim to be cast into a furnace. He had a pile of wood set on fire, and Ibrahim was cast into it. Ibrahim proclaimed the true faith in Allah, knowing full well that Nimrud, whom the idolaters worshipped as god, would put him to death. Likewise Imam Husayn, the Ibrahim of Karbala, a descendant of Ibrahim about whom he had taken a promise from Allah to make him an Imam as He appointed Ibrahim an Imam over the mankind (Baqarah: 124), proclaimed and upheld the true religion of Allah, knowing full well that the Nimrud of his times, Yazid bin. Mu-awiyah, would put him to death. Like the idolaters of Nimrud the followers of Yazid also hung their heads in shame and are being cursed and condemned by all reasonable human beings in every age.\nImam Husayn said to the followers of Yazid:\n\"Safeguard yourselves against evil. Fear the wrath of the Lord.\"\nAlmost the same warning was given by Ibrahim in verses 66 and 67. The enemies of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt persecuted and killed the holy Ahl ul Bayt one after another and also their true followers when they could not deny their rights and privileges bestowed on them by Allah on account of their excellences and achievements, just as the idolaters of Nimrud decided to burn him and protect their ideologies and creeds.\nWhen Ibrahim was being thrown into the fire several angels requested Allah to allow them to save Ibrahim from the blazing fire. \"Help him if he seeks your help\" was the reply. They came to him, but he said: \"It is between me and my Lord. Let His will be done.\" Jibra-il advised him to beseech Allah for help. Ibrahim said: \"My Lord knows that which is taking place.\" As the chosen friend of Allah, Ibrahim put his trust in Allah. Every messenger or prophet of Allah did the same as Ibrahim did whenever there was a trust, but the Christians have lowered the status of Isa by fabricating false stories about him in Matthew 26: 39 and 27: 46. It is stated therein that when Isa was to be crucified he said:\n\"My heart is ready to break with grief.\" He went on a little, fell on his face in prayer, and said: \"My father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Yet not as \"I will, but as You will\".\nAnd about three Jesus cried aloud: \"Eli, Eli, Lema sabachthani\"? which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"\nThis could not be Isa. These words must have been spoken by the man who was crucified in his place.\nHusayn bin Ali, the divinely chosen Imam in the progeny of Ibrahim, gave the same reply to the angels which Ibrahim had given to them when he rested his forehead on the burning sand of Karbala in prostration before his Lord at the time of Asr prayers. While swords, arrows, spears, daggers, lances and stones were cutting up his body, he said:\n\"O Merciful Lord of the worlds! Husayn, Thy servant, has sacrificed in Thy way everything he had received from Thee.\nAccept the humble sacrifice of Thy servant. If 1, the grandson of Thy messenger, had more, I would have surrendered that too to Thee willingly.\nO my Lord! Be merciful, oft-forgiving to those of Thy sincere servants who are less careful in Thy obedience.\"\nThe Lord of the worlds said: \"O My beloved! May I help you?\"-(to free you from the clutches of the accursed followers of Shaytan)-The Imam said:\n\"O my Lord! I seek Thy help to keep me steadfast in this hour of service to Thee to the utmost degree which shall please Thee the most.\"\nWhen Ibrahim was thrown into the fire, the fire became cool and a means of safety for Ibrahim under the command of Allah.\nThe persecutors of Ibrahim were the worst losers. A host of mosquitoes attacked them. One mosquito entered into the brain of Nimrud through his nostrils and killed him. For the blessings Ibrahim received from his Lord refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 124.\nFor what pleased Allah most concerning Imam Husayn see commentary of As Saffat : 107 wherein the sacrifice of Husayn has been described as \"dhibhin azim\" - the greatest sacrifice.\n"

Both of them came to prophet Dawud for equitable settlement. Dawud awarded Elia, the owner of the cultivated field, the flock of sheep belonging to John in compensation for the loss he suffered. Prophet Sulayman son of Dawud was a mere boy of eleven, but he thought of a better decision, where the penalty would better fit the offence. Sulayman's suggestion was that John should cultivate Elia's field and return it to Elia when it was fully restored to the condition before eaten up by his herd; and in the meantime Elia should take possession of John's sheep and use only their milk and wool and return them to John when he gave him back his field duly cultivated. This is because Allah is present every where and having witnessed the whole affair He inspired Sulayman to arrive at the true judgement. As prophets of Allah neither spoke nor acted except as directed by Allah both the decisions were announced as inspired by Allah. The decision of Dawud was based upon the law current at that time. Dawud had many sons. It was Allah's will that Sulayman should be given the prophethood. So after this case in which the young Sulayman was inspired to announce a new judgement, superseding the current law, Dawud, under Allah's command, made Sulayman his heir, and after Dawud, Sulayman was appointed by Allah as His prophet.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAs also said in Saba: 10- \"O mountains!

Ibrahim, from atop the mountain of Abu Qubays, made the announcement. His voice is meant for all those who were and are destined to perform the pilgrimage till the day of resurrection. When the Holy Prophet decided to go to the house of Allah in 10 Hijra, verse 27 was revealed. A very large number of Muslims came in response to the call of the Holy Prophet. The pilgrimage is known as hajjah al wida (the last pilgrimage), after which the historic event of Ghadir Khum took place. Please refer to the commentary of al Ma-idah: 5 and 67.\nTo know the moral, spiritual and material excellences of hajj please refer to the commentary of the abovenoted verses of al Baqarah and Ali Imran.\nVerse 27 was revealed in Makka. Historically the Muslims were passing through a most difficult time. A group of helpless Muslims were sent to Abyssinia to escape from the relentless persecution of the pagan Quraysh. The Holy Prophet along with his family and the remaining companions left Makka to take refuge in Madina permanently. The city of Makka was in the control of the polytheists who publicly declared their plans to kill the Holy Prophet, his relatives and his followers. It was a miracle of Allah that under such adverse circumstances and despite universal hostility the house of Allah, built by Ibrahim and Ismail, became the centre of Islam in the years that followed this proclamation. This miracle is a lasting evidence of the truthfulness of the Holy Prophet and the religion of Allah, Islam, till eternity.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nHajj is described as mash-had, a place to be present and attend the meeting to witness universal advantages. Id prayers have also been described by the holy Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt as a general place for witnessing or meeting in this sense.\nImam Ali bin Musa ar Rida said:\n\"The two rakats have been replaced by the two sermons in Friday prayers because on Friday a general meeting or witnessing takes place.\"\nThe congregational devotion and worship gives an opportunity to the believers to meet and know each other better, to pay homage to their leader (Imam), and to receive guidance from him or from his representative.\nFor bayt al atiq (the ancient house) refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 125, 126 and Ali Imran : 96.\nFor lawful food refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 173, al Ma-idah: 3 and 4 and An-am: 122, 139 and 147.\nHurumat refers to the sacred laws and rites prescribed by Allah.\nZur, according to the Ahl ul Bayt, are the \"vain words\", including any utterances disapproved by Allah.\nAccording to the scholars among the followers of ahl al dhikr (the people of the holy Quran), the Ahl ul Bayt, Zur also refers to music since it is composed of \"vain sounds and voices.\"\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 22:52]\nTo confuse people so as to make them misinterpret the verses of the Quran Shaytan plants doubts in their minds about the Holy Prophet and the words of Allah he recited. Some translators and commentators have drawn misconceived and mischievous conclusions to belittle the high status of the Holy Prophet in order to bring him on the level of those ordinary men whom they accept as their leaders, mentioned in Qasas: 41. Please refer to the commentary of Bani Israil: 71.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nSome pagans and hypocrites planned secretly to recite words praising idolatry alongside the recitation of the Holy Prophet, while he was praying, in such a way that the people would think as if they were recited by him. Once when the Holy Prophet was reciting verses 19 and 20 of Najm one of the pagans recited: \"Tilkal gharani-ul ula wa inna shafa-atahuma laturja\"-(These are the lofty (idols), verily their intercession is sought after.) As soon as this was recited the conspirators shouted in delight to make the people believe that it was the Holy Prophet who said these words. Here, the Quran is stating the general pattern the enemies of the messengers of Allah followed when they were positively convinced that the people were paying attention to the teachings of the messengers of Allah and sincerely believing in them. They would mix their false doctrines with the original teachings so as to make the divine message a bundle of contradictions. This kind of satanic insertions are referred to in thus verse, and it is supported by Ha Mim: 26. It is sheer blasphemy to say that satanic forces can influence the messengers of Allah. The Quran has repeatedly asserted that Shaytan shall have no authority whatsoever over the purified servants of Allah. Please refer to the commentary of Ibrahim: 22 and Nahl: 99 and 100 according to which Shaytan has no authority over the purified servants of Allah.\n"

The Holy Prophet is a witness over these thoroughly purified witnesses. At the revelation of this verse the Holy Prophet said:\n\"Only thirteen men have been addressed in this verse.

They are humble before Allah because they are fully aware of their worthlessness in the presence of the absolute omnipotent authority of the Lord-master.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"If a person is aware of his insignificance in the presence of the supreme majesty of the authority of the Lord, he will certainly manifest it in his actions done before Him.\"\nIn the battle of Uhad, the sharp point of an arrow stuck into the foot of Ali ibn abi Talib and could not be removed because the head of the arrow broke when it was being taken out. As advised by the Holy Prophet it was pulled out when Ali was praying salat. He did not know what took place. After the completion of his prayer he noticed blood on the prayer-mat and realised that the broken part of the arrow was taken out from his foot. He used to be so much involved in his communion with his Lord-master that on several occasions people thought he was dead.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"In qiyam the prayer must look steadily at the point where the forehead is placed in sajdah; in ruku at the place between the two feet; in qunut at the palms of the joined hands; in sajdah at the nose; in qu-ud (sitting position to recite tashahud) at the thighs. Concentration of heart and mind at the time of offering salat so as to think nothing but about Allah is essential to acknowledge the presence of the authority of the Lord-master.\"\nAt the time of ablution (wudu) the awe and reverence of the glory of Allah Ali felt was always visible on his face, because, as he himself explained, he was getting ready to stand in the presence of the majesty of Allah as a humblest servant should stand before his Lord-master. Likewise the body of Imam Ali bin Husayn Zayn al Abidin used to shake from awe and reverence of Allah whenever he went to offer prayers.\nThe holy Ahl ul Bayt, thoroughly purified by Allah (Ahzab: 33), alone possessed the sublime qualities mentioned in this verse. They are the divinely chosen models for the true believers. So, as the Holy Prophet said, the Ahl ul Bayt are like the ark of Nuh; whosoever follows them is saved from evil and its consequences, and whosoever rejects them goes astray and is lost for ever.\n"

In this process the parts which were in the earlier stage co-related or played procreative role in subsequent stage of growth, change their relation with each other. Likewise the universe with its evolutionary movement to the absolute, along with its parts and components, will not retain the same relation in the final stage; but it does not mean there will be no relation at all. The life in the hereafter is more spiritual and sublime than here.

The punishment should be open, in order to be deterrent. There can be no leniency in enforcing this law because as said in verse 1 it is Allah who has ordained this punishment. As the punishment is severe the proof of the offence has to be beyond all possibilities of concoction. Let not even the slightest shade of falsehood play a part in such cases (see commentary of Nisa: 15 and 16).\nTo give an example of how meticulous one should be in judging such cases an event that took place in the reign of Umar bin Khattab is narrated below:\nSix persons, accused of adultery, were produced before the then caliph, Umar bin Khattab. At once he sentenced them to flogging, each of them with a hundred stripes. When Ali pointed out to him that his judgement was in contravention of the divine law, Umar requested him to give his own judgement.\nAli said:\nExecute the first.\nStone to death the second.\nPunish the third with a hundred stripes.\nPunish the fourth with fifty stripes. Warn the fifth and set him free.\nSet the sixth free without any penalty.\nAll wondered as to why Ali gave a different verdict for each of the 6 persons tried for the same crime.\nAli explained:\nThe first is a dhimmi, a disbeliever under the protection of the Muslim state, who committed the crime of adultery with a believing woman, and having violated the law of Islam has ceased to be a dhimmi, therefore he must be executed.\nThe second is a married man whose punishment is stoning to death.\nThe third is to be flogged with a hundred stripes because he is a bachelor.\nThe fourth is a slave, so fifty stripes is his punishment .\nThe fifth has only been warned because he was caught in the crime inadvertently.\nThe sixth is insane, so the law cannot be applied on him.\nThen Umar said:\n\"Had there not been Ali, Umar would have perished.\"\nIn almost all modern societies adultery is regarded as a social misconduct, but Islam categorises it among the most heinous crimes, because it destroys the very social fabric of the society and makes the lives of the affected individuals so miserable that they feel as if they are neither living nor dead. The essential harmony of the Society is ruined beyond recovery .\nRefer to Deuteronomy 17: 5.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"A party of the believers\" are those who have not committed any crime, and who know the divine laws and their true application.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 24:11]\nThe particular incident referred to here occurred on the return from the defensive expedition of the Bani Mustaliq in 5-6 Hijra. At one of the halts, A-isha, the Holy Prophet's wife, withdrew from the camp to cleanse herself in the nearby desert. There she lost her necklace. As it was dark there she took time to discover it. In the meantime the march was ordered. As her litter was veiled, it was not noticed that she was not in it. When she returned to the camp, she could do nothing but wait. She fell asleep. Next morning she was found by Safwan who had been left behind to pick up anything inadvertently left behind. He put her on his camel and brought her, leading the camel on foot. This episode furnished some malicious enemies of the Holy Prophet, particularly the hypocrites, with an opportunity to raise a scandalous storm in order to hurt the feelings of the Holy Prophet. The ringleader among them was the chief of the Madina hypocrites, Abdullah ibn Ubay. Mistah, her uncle, also helped him. Ibn Ubay is referred to as the man who \"took on himself the lead among them\" to spread the scandal.\nAli ibn abi Talib knew that it was an obvious lie (as said in verse 12), concocted to hurt the Holy Prophet, so he asked Burayrah, the maid of A-isha, to tell the mischief-makers the truth about her mistress. On Burayrah's report the scandal was diffused.\nFor verse 13 refer to the commentary of verse 4.\nMistah was a sahabi (companion) of the Holy Prophet but because of his role in the incident he was punished by the Holy Prophet. It shows that every sahabi was not righteous. According to Allah's law (indallah) four witnesses have to be produced even if the accusation is true.\nPeople may think it is an insignificant matter to speak lightly of something which damages a person's character or reputation, but with Allah it is a most serious matter in all cases, particularly when it involves the honour and reputation of pious men and women.\nDissemination of scandalous news and gossip is a wide-spread social evil. In modern times it is carried out through books and magazines.\nFor thorough purification see commentary of Ahzab: 33 and for partial purification verse 26 of this surah.\nVerse 22 refers to Abu Bakr, the father of A-isha, and Mistah, his cousin. Abu Bakr was given ample means by Allah. He used to support Mistah, but after this incident he withdrew his help. According to the highest standards of Islamic ethics, as said in this verse, a truly generous patron should not, in personal anger, withdraw his support even from a delinquent if he is in need. The general application holds good for all time. Those who desire that Allah should forgive their faults must be forgiving and merciful in their dealings with men who have wronged them.\n"

To remove the contradiction it is necessary to restrict the meaning of the cleanness to chastity and impurity to adultery in this verse, because it was revealed in connection with the accusation of adultery. \"They are free from what they say\" confirms it.

Not to look freely at the faces of the women who are not his sisters, daughters, mothers or wives is the fundamental injunction to put a complete ban on the lusting with the eyes which serves as a most powerful agency for the prevention and control of sexual crimes. The way in which sense-perceptions give rise to sex stimulation can hardly be overrated. Islam does not allow free and unrestricted intermingling of the sexes. It insists upon segregation of the sexes and bans altogether lewd audio and video presentation of life, real as well as imaginary. It completely bans every form of nudity.\nOn account of the differentiation of the sexes in nature, temperament, and social life, a stricter discipline is required for woman than for man, especially in the matter of dress and public exhibition of the beauty of the body. Zinat implies the beauty of the body as well as the adornment a women adds to make it more attractive and stimulating.\nThe woman is asked not to make a display of her figure except to the classes of people mentioned in verse 31.\nIt is reported that once Abdullah bin Makhtum, a blind companion of the Holy Prophet, came to meet him at his daughter's house. Bibi Fatimah immediately went inside her room. Afterwards she told her father that she went away because, although Abdullah was a blind man, she was not. Earlier in a similar situation the Holy Prophet had advised his wives Ummi Salima and Maymuna not to stay in the company of even a blind man like Abdullah because of the same reason Bibi Fatimah had given.\nThe Holy Prophet has strongly disapproved the women who do not keep their bodies clean and attractive for their husbands, or give false excuses to avoid the fulfilment of their husband's desires. He has also condemned the husbands who allow their wives to display the beauty of their bodies to others. In another tradition it is stated that the Holy Prophet has advised all wives to obey the instructions of their husbands, no matter what the circumstances are, because obedience and faithfulness unto their husbands would earn forgiveness of the sins they have committed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThese verses contain the legislation regarding modesty in dress, and discipline in intermingling of sexes, for both men and women. Women are not allowed to display their parts of body, adorned or not, to men except those mentioned in verse 31. They have to cover their bodies except face, hands (from the wrist) and feet (including ankles), but they should not be adorned as to stimulate sexual desire when they go out of their homes. There is no restriction on them if they have to come out from their houses. In any event what the Muslim women are doing under the influence of western civilisation is against the tenets of Islam.\n"

The choice of the spouse should not be influenced by beauty or wealth. There is no better quality than righteousness to be sought in the life-partner.\nThere is no other alternative for normal human beings except fulfilment of sexual desires through lawful means. So the act of wedding is in itself a virtue. It is essential for the continuation of life on the earth in order to serve the meaningful plan of the author of the universe. Any deviation from the law laid down by Allah to discipline this procreative activity not only leads to unmanageable disorder but also condemns the human soul to spiritual depravity and devastation.\nThe normal way to the life of perfection is marriage, not celibacy, suppression of the natural urge which is given to man for continuation of life. Celibacy is unnatural. It is a denial of the divine plan. So it never worked as a genuine activity. In the subterranean dwellings of almost all the monasteries thousands of skeletons of murdered children have been found. According to the Holy Prophet a true Muslim has to marry, not for the satisfaction of lust or for acquisition of wealth, but to bring righteous servants of Allah in this world for the service and worship of the Lord. He declared that nikah (wedlock) was his way of life. Allah has promised to give necessary means of sustenance to every created being that lives in this world, so not to marry for the fear of poverty amounts to want of trust in Allah. The modern tendency to satisfy sex desires through \"permissive means\" and \"living together\" by avoiding the discipline of matrimony and its consequences on the false excuse of insufficient means to bear the burden of \"more mouths to feed\" is unislamic.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"A two rakat salat prayed by a married person is better than the whole night of prayers and a day of fasting spent by an unmarried person.\"\nEvery healthy person with sufficient means is liable to seek fulfilment of the sexual desire, so it is obligatory to marry, otherwise the outlet would be adultery.\n"

If he cannot afford to maintain a family he must wait for Allah's grace and keep himself chaste until Allah gives him sufficient means. In religion fasting has been recommended for such a person.\nKitab refers to a written instrument which allows a slave to redeem himself on paying a certain amount. This document obliges the master to set his slave at liberty on receiving the agreed amount which the slave collects either by his labour or by receiving donations from others. See fiqh.\nSlavery is now obsolete. Islam made it possible to put an end to slavery by enacting laws which, step by step, gave freedom to slaves. See the commentary of al Baqarah: 177. To set a slave free was considered to be one of the most distinguishing qualities of a believer. The Holy Prophet came with the divine message of Islam in a world wholly governed by the institution of slavery. A worst form of slavery was the basis of all human activity, social, economic and political. In such a predominantly slave-based system of social order Islam began to liberate slaves. According to Imam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq it is the duty of a true believer to forgo the agreed amount if the slave desires freedom. Although the Imams among the Ahl ul Bayt gave freedom to their slaves but it is a historic fact that most of them refused to leave the service of the Imams. Even today the free followers of these Imams feel proud to say that they are the slaves (followers) of the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt.\nWhat is now called the \"white slave traffic\" was carried on by wicked people like Abdullah ibn Obay who hired six women slaves for prostitution. According to this verse no more despicable trade can be imagined, so it is emphatically condemned and prohibited.\n"

The physical light is but a reflection of the true light in the realm of reality, and that true light is Allah. The performance of light is to manifest. It is Allah who manifests the universe. The human beings can only think of the factors of the spiritual world in terms of the phenomenal experience obtainable through physical senses; and in the phenomenal world light is the purest thing known to man. Due to the limitations of human experience man cannot see the real light but perceive only the lighted objects. So the physical experience is an illusion, because physical light has drawbacks incidental to its physical nature. It is dependent upon some source external to itself; it is a passing phenomenon; if it is taken to be a form of motion or energy it is unstable, like all physical phenomena; and it is dependent on space and time. The perfect light of Allah is free from any such defects. It prevails everywhere. It envelops everything. It is independent of time and space. The niche (mishkat) is the recess in the wall, high from the ground in the house. The divine light, according to the parable, is placed high above everything, all that which has been created, the whole universe. The lamp is the core of the real illumination. It is placed inside a glass which protects it from any outside interference or disturbance (refer to Saff: 8). The illumination shines bright like a star. In this world, governed by the laws of cause and effect, it becomes natural to know what makes the lamp burn, as no lamp burns without oil. So to give man the idea of causative factor of the generation of light, it is said that the oil of the blessed tree of olive keeps the lamp alive. It is said that after the great flood, the olive tree was the first to grow on the earth. This mystic olive is not localised. It is neither of the east nor of the west. It is universal like the light of Allah.\nThe light of wisdom (the Quran) in the heart of the Holy Prophet is as protected as the lamp in the glass. Verses 77 to 79 of al Waqi-ah clearly state that the Quran is a protected book; and no one can touch it save the thoroughly purified, the Ahl ul Bayt, according to the verse 33 of Ahzab. Therefore the true interpretation of \"light upon light\" is the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt. It is further made clear in the next verse.\nFor \"Allah guides whom He wills to His light\" see the commentary of al Baqarah: 256 and 257-he who believes in Allah, indeed, has taken hold of the firmest handhold (or rope) which will not break off. Allah brings them out of the darkness into light-It is obvious that those who are guided unto His light are the thoroughly purified ones. They alone are the manifestations of the real light. Those who follow these reflection of the divine light receive guidance from the grace of Allah to the extend or degree of their sincere attachment to them. Salman was the only companion of the Holy Prophet who achieved the distinction of becoming one of the Ahl ul Bayt.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"My Ahl ul Bayt are like the ark of Nuh. Whosoever sails on it is safe, and whosoever holds back shall perish.\"\nNubuwwah and imamah, jointly or separately, are the most perfect guidance unto the light of Allah. Allah Himself chooses and appoints the guide, but His choice is not arbitrary. There are conditions which have to be fulfilled. Refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 124. When Allah appointed Ibrahim as an Imam after testing his faith and awareness, for the whole mankind, he requested Allah to continue this august office in his progeny. Allah agreed to do so, but \"it is a covenant which shall not reach the unjust (zalim)\" was added. According to verse 13 of Luqman polytheism is the greatest injustice (zulm), therefore as explained in detail in the commentary of al Baqarah: 124 the Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet was the only group which never worshipped any ghayrallah. Those who had worshipped idols at any time in their lives could not be chosen as Imams at all, but after becoming Muslims if they had accepted the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt as their guides, and followed them, then, according to the degree of their sincerity and awareness, they are entitled to occupy suitable position in the journey towards the enlightenment available from the light of Allah. Mere verbal profession of faith in Allah without attachment to the Ahl ul Bayt is as bad as hypocrisy.\nThe existence of the supreme being has been compared to light in order to make human intellect understand a great attribute of Allah, otherwise He is the inconceivable absolute who has created the light. Light is His manifestation. It is not His being.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nTo know the proper application of ayah al Nur the following points should be kept in view:\n(i) It is a parable.\n(ii) A parable implies several applications corresponding to various aspects.\n(iii) The light should be understood in its widest sense, as a self-evident being which is evident by itself, and through which other beings become evident.\n(iv) The light emanating from a source may pass through transparent or opaque mediums. Generally it is not serviceable when it passes through an opaque medium but is profitable when it goes through a transparent medium.\nTransparent mediums have different degrees of transparency. Better conductivity depends on the degree of refinement and purification of the medium.\nThere may be a source or cause which produces the light. It may also be self-illuminating .\n(vii) Usually light proceeding from a source illuminates a particular area, leaving other areas unlighted.\n(viii) The source of the light, in this verse, is not localised. It is neither of the east nor the west-not any particular area or direction. See my note in Maryam: 16 to 40.\n(ix) The parable is applicable to the process of creation as well as to guidance and also to legislation in order to regulate human behaviour both as an individual and as a member of society.\n(x) Light as a symbol of guidance is one of the attributes of Allah. It is manifested in both the realms of creation and legislation.\nAllah is the light through which every created being comes into evidence, and every being is guided toward the destination where it should reach. To reach to the destination of salvation, bliss and satisfaction it has to do that which guidance points out.\nIn every realm and sphere there is a point in which the light of creation or guidance manifests itself originally, and then illuminates the surroundings. Niche {mishtat) refers to this \"point\" as the exalted holy place chosen for the manifestation of Allah's name and attributes. There should be an entity whose cognitive self becomes the focus of light. Such entities have been pointed out clearly in Ahzab: 33 and Ali Imran: 61 as the first and the foremost in receiving the light of existence in the arc of descent and the-last in the arc of ascent. In the realm of creation they are the best entities or \"points\" in which the light of creation manifested itself originally. In the realm of legislation and guidance too they are the best models.\nIf applied to any individual the niche is the power of expression and the \"house\" (in which the niche is situated) is the body.\nIf applied to the group of the Ahl ul Bayt and the prophets, the niche in the house is the Holy Prophet.\nThe divine light passed through the purest transparent chain of prophets, without any detour, and manifested itself in its full glory in the Holy Prophet, to illuminate the human society for ever.\nAll the mediums-lamp, glass etcetera-which are the various stages between the original source and the final spreading of the light should be of the highest transparency so as not to affect the purity of light passing through them. It implies that the minds, hearts, loins and wombs of the ancestors of the Holy Prophet were free from the dirt of polytheism.\nThe house in which the niche always remained is described in verse 36. There always exists a group of persons whose hearts and minds are fully occupied with the remembrance of Allah.\nThe niche is the source of light, and the oil of the blessed tree is a pure \"light above light\". There is not a slightest trace of darkness. Darkness or evil exists outside the sphere of the houses in which the niche is located and cannot enter into it.\nAlso refer to the commentary of al Baqarah: 275; Nisa: 175 ; Ma-idah: 1 5 and Yunus: 87.\n"

In this verse the disbelievers' fate is compared to the disappointment of a traveller in the desert who sees false image of water and pursues it with conviction that he will quench his thirst when he reaches it, but as soon as he comes up to it, he finds it to be a mirage (nothing), and dies in protracted agony.\nSee commentary of al Baqarah: 48, 123, 254,; An-am: 165 and Bani Israil: 15 for \"Allah will pay him his account.\"\nImam Ali said:\n\"Allah shall take account of all at one and the same time as He gives sustenance to them all without a break or gap in His divine system of nourishing and cherishing the living beings all over the universe.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nFirst the perfect man has been presented as the niche and the inhabitants of the divine house as those through whom the divine light spreads to guide all mankind.

A man who belies and rejects the message of Allah presented to him with clear signs and decisive arguments can go no where but to the bottom of utter darkness.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"My followers will cross the bridge of sirat guided and aided by the light of Ali, and Ali by my light, and I by the light of Allah. Those who are not attached with us shall not have the light to cross it, because to whom Allah does not give light, for him there is no light.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nVerses 123 of An-am and 52 of Shura, together with this verse, clearly indicate that the light of guidance comes from the divine source-prophets, Imams and the revealed scriptures.

The verses of the Quran mentioned in this connection assert that the supporter should have the same qualities and purification of soul as the person who is supported has.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Ali is my brother here and in the hereafter.

The root meaning of rass is an old well or shallow water-pit. They were people who disobeyed their prophet and were destroyed.\nImam Ali bin Musa ar Ridha reported on the authority of Imam Husayn bin Ali that a man from Banu Tamim came to Ali and asked him as to who were the people of al Rass.\nImam Ali said:\n\"You have asked a question no one has yet investigated; and there is no one except me who can give you the answer because there is no verse in the Quran but I know when, where and why it was revealed. The treasures of knowledge Allah has given me are inexhaustible, but there are very few who want to know. The seekers of truth and wisdom shall miss me when they will not find me among them to know that which is unknown to any scholar.\nThe people of al Rass worshipped the pine tree which Yafas, son of Nuh, planted beside a spring called Dushab, particularly created by Allah for Nuh, after the great flood. After Sulayman, son of Dawud, there were twelve towns, between Adharbayjan and Arminia on the river known as Rass, in which these people lived. The names of the twelve towns were\n(i) Aban (ii) Adhur (iii) Day (iv) Bahman (v) Isfandar (vi) Farwardin (vii) Ardi Bahist (vii) Khurdad (ix) Mardad (x) Tir (xi) Mihr (xii) Shahryur. Isfandar was the largest town in which was the pine tree the people worshipped. Tarkuz son of Ghayur son of Yarishk son of Sazan son of Nimrud son of Kanan was their king. It was strictly prohibited to use the water of the spring for any purpose because if it dried, they presumed, their god would die. An Israelite prophet, a descendant of prophet Yaqub, was sent to show the right path of Allah to them, but they did not give up the worship of the pine tree. At last Allah made the tree dead. The people, in a fury of revenge, buried the prophet alive in a well. Then the wrath of Allah seized them. All perished. No one survived.\"\n(Manhaj al Sadiqin and Umdah al Bayan)\n"

It is weakened light caused by an opaque object facing the source of light. The shadow changes length and direction due to the movement of the light-giving object, otherwise it would retain its length for ever as described in verses 71 and 72 of al Qasas. The shadow follows the light in reverse. The relation between light and shadow is so geometrically fixed that many astronomical calculations are based upon it.\nAccording to the theosophical interpretation the whole dimensional sphere is a shadow of the non-physical sphere about it, and this non-physical sphere is the shadow of another spiritual sphere above it, and like that it continues upto the last sphere of finite being. The length of the shadow increases and decreases in proportion to the extent it turns towards the infinite or absolute light.\nIt is mentioned in Minhaj al Sadiqin and Umdah al Bayan that the withdrawal of light refers to the period between Isa and the Holy Prophet, in which there was a temporary suspension of the heavenly guidance. Another interpretation refers to the miraculous event of the return of the sunlight after the sun had set when the Holy Prophet invoked Allah so that Imam Ali could pray his afternoon salat which he missed because the Holy Prophet, in the state of receiving revelation, was reposing in his lap. This event has been reported in Tarikh al Khamis, Rawzat al Ahbab, Habib al Siyar and Rawdzat al Safa.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 25:54]\nIt is mentioned in Rawdzat al Ahbab and Tarikh al Khamis, and also reported by Tabari, Tibrani, Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ibn Asakir that the betrothal of Fatimah and Ali - as revealed to the Holy Prophet - was ordained by Allah, who, the Holy Prophet said to his daughter, had informed him of His choice from the noblest on the earth of two blessed men, one being her father and the other her husband; and that He had decreed his (the Holy Prophet's) lineal descendants to spring forth from the couple (Ali and Fatimah) and not from himself.\nEarlier, before their marriage, Abu Bakr, Umar and Abdur Rahman had expressed their desires to marry the daughter of the Holy Prophet, but the Holy Prophet made known the fact to all and sundry that Allah would choose the husband of Fatimah. Then they went to Ali, and, after telling him about their unsuccessful attempt, advised him to try his hand at this venture, as to marry Bibi Fatimah was a great privilege and the best blessings Allah could bestow on a man in this world and the hereafter. Ali went to the house of Ummi Salima and knocked at the door. The Holy Prophet was in. He said to Ummi Salima: \"Go and open the door. On your door is standing the man who loves Allah and the messenger of Allah and Allah and His messenger love him the most.\" Ali entered, greeted the Holy Prophet and sat before him with his usual graceful demureness.\nThe Holy Prophet asked: \"What it is that brings you here? Do you want to marry Fatimah?\"\nAli said: \"O Messenger of Allah, you have brought me up as your own son. You alone have the right to decide everything that concerns me.\"\n\"What can you offer as a dower?\" The Holy Prophet asked.\n\"Everything is known to you. I have a horse, a camel, a coat of mail and a sword,\" Ali replied.\n\"You need the horse and the sword to defend the truth, the camel to earn your livelihood, but you do not need the coat of mail, so sell it,\" said the Holy Prophet.\nAli sold it for 500 dirhams. When he brought the money to pay the dower, the Holy Prophet informed Ali that the man to whom he sold the coat of mail was Jibrail.\n\"O Ali, Jibrail has returned the coat of mail to me and conveyed the decree of Allah that your marriage with Fatimah has already been solemnized in the heaven and I have been I commanded to do the same here,\" said the Holy Prophet.\n"

Only the Holy Prophet had the unique distinction of receiving Allah's command to say to those of his followers who want to take the way to Allah. As said in Shura : 23 \"No recompense do I ask of you for this (the toils of the prophethood) except the love of (my) relatives (Ahl ul Bayt).\" It implies that the Ahl ul Bayt is the only means of access to Allah. Therefore whoso pays the recompense derives benefits for himself as made clear in verse 47 of Saba. The Holy Prophet's recompense is only due from Allah.\n"

Abdullah bin Zubayr, Abu Sufyan bin Harith, Zuhayra bin abi Wahab and Sami bin Abd Munaf used to compose poems in praise of idols and in denunciation of their enemies, always indulging in fancies and phantasms divorced from truth. They very often painted viciousness so vividly and alluringly as to excite passions and darken the intellect and erode the power of reasoning.

The voice came from the direction of the fire, or the right side of the valley, or from the tree (Qasas: 30).\nThe fear Musa felt was not the fear of the serpents, nor was Musa afraid of the harm that could occur to him but he was apprehensive of the possible confusion that could mislead the people. No Prophet could have any fright in the presence of Allah. So the false accusation of fright attributed to the Holy Prophet when Jibrail came with the first revelation should be rejected outright as a blasphemy. Refer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 48.\n"

Allah sent Dawud nine questions with answers and asked him to appoint the son who gives the correct answers as his successor.\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nANSWERS\n(i)\n\nWhich is the nearest thing?\n\nHereafter.\n(ii)\n\nWhich is the farthest thing?\n\nTime passed away\n(iii)\n\nWhat phenomenon manifests love?\n\nBody with soul.\n(iv)\n\nWhat phenomenon manifests dread?\n\nBody without soul.\n(v)\n\nWhich things remain the same?\n\nSky and earth.\n(vi)\n\nWhich things ever remain different?\n\nDay and night.\n(vii)\n\nWhich things are opposed to each other.\n\nLife and death.\n(viii)\n\nWhat ends in - goodness?\n\nPatience and forbearance at the time of anger.\n(ix)\n\nWhat ends in evil?\n\nHaste at the time of anger\nNone save Sulayman, the youngest son, gave the correct answers, so he was made the heir of Dawud.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe law of inheritance stated in this verse is the law of the Lord, and no one can ever make changes in the laws of the Lord save Himself or the Holy Prophet under His command (Bani Israil : 77). Now refer to the commentary of Bani Israil : 26; Nahl: 90 and Maryam: 2 to 15 for the issue of Fadak. To deprive Bibi Fatimah of her rightful inheritance a false tradition (The prophets of Allah neither inherit nor leave inheritance) was quoted. The Holy Prophet was a law-giver, therefore he could never break any law made by Allah. He was the best exemplar of the laws and doctrines preached by him.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Whenever you hear a tradition attributed to me, compare it with the Quran, and, if there is no contradiction between the two, accept it, otherwise reject it outright.\"\nDawud who chose Sulayman, a prophet, to inherit his kingdom was also a prophet, therefore the tradition quoted to deprive Bibi Fatimah of her rightful inheritance was undoubtedly false. Please note that the superior most prophet of Allah, Muhammad al Mustafa, was granted all the wisdom, knowledge and authority over all created beings which was given to other prophets, in the highest degree by the most generous giver of all givers.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 27:20]\nThese verses narrate the story of Saba or the queen of Sheba of the Bible (refer to chapters 10 and 11 of I Kings) whose Arabic name was Bilqis. Hudhud (hoopoe) is a light, graceful bird, with a yellow crest on its head. This bird served Sulayman as an efficient scout, and also used to discover water beneath the surface of the earth, as if a X-ray device was fixed in its eyes.\nTafaqqad literally means to find out a defect, but in verse 20 it is used for making an enquiry.\nWhen Sulayman took a muster of the birds, he did not find the hoopoe, because he had a good reason for his absence. At that time he was surveying the vast realm of Saba, the queen of Sheba, where he went along with another hoopoe who met him while he was flying to report to Sulayman and (the other hoopoe) gave him an explicit description of the grandeur of her dominion, after hearing the might and glory of Sulayman's kingdom. Sulayman's hoopoe came back and told him what he saw, particularly about their religion that she and her people were the worshippers of the sun.\nIt is desirable (mustahab) to prostrate one's self in adoration before Allah after reciting verse 26.\nTo test the hoopoe's report Sulayman wrote a letter to Saba; and asked the hoopoe to go and deliver his letter to her and bring her reply.\nSulayman expressly began his letter with bismillahir rahmanir rahim, on which is based the true religion of unity of Allah, and invited her and her people to the true faith, not for worldly conquest but for the spreading of the light (guidance and wisdom) of Allah.\nThe queen, after consultation with her courtiers, decided to send a few gifts to Sulayman in order to find out that Sulayman was not like ordinary kings who conquer by violence. When her embassy came to Sulayman with the gifts, he refused to accept them because firstly Allah had given him better than that which He had given her, and secondly he was expecting her submission to the true religion. He told the embassy that soon his army would drive them forth from there, disgraced and humbled. After the embassy had departed he asked his chiefs: \"Who can bring me her with her throne, before they come to me in submission.\" A large, powerful jinn offered his services and assured Sulayman that he would do it before he would rise from his council. However strong and big a creature might be, it was not possible for him to go to a distant land and bring her and her throne in a few moments, unless the jinn had supernatural powers to do it. Although the jinn had boasted of his strength and supernatural power, yet when a man who had knowledge of the book said that he would bring them to him within the twinkling of an eye, Sulayman gave him permission. Soon the Queen, with her throne, was before him. See commentary of Rad: 43 to know about him who had the knowledge of the book. It is reported by Abu Ishaq Thalabi that Abdullah bin Salam asked the Holy Prophet to give the name of the man who had knowledge of the book and brought the queen of Sheba with her throne within the twinkling of an eye. The Holy Prophet said: \"It was Ali.\"\nIt is stated in Minhaj al Sadiqin and Umdat al Bayan that then the Holy Prophet said to Ali:\n\"O Ali, you helped all the prophets of Allah incognito (concealed from view), and you help me in propria persona (in person) manifestly.\"\nAli ibn abi Talib is known as mazhar al aja-ib and mazhar al ghara-ib because, as willed by Allah, he used to appear in different forms to carry out divine plans under very special circumstances. These two epithets are exclusively reserved for Ali. Even today the true believers invoke Allah to send him for help. The famous dua, known as Nadi Ali, which the Holy Prophet recited, as commanded by Allah, at Khaybar refers to Ali as mazhar al aja-ib. Ali ibn abi Talib is also known as mushkil kusha, the remover of hardships. In every age, to many persons he comes personally to remove hardships. Through his name great spiritual achievements are attained. The Holy Prophet, and after him, Ali are acknowledged as the most superior possessors of the spiritual powers.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe last sentence of verse 40 asserts that man's submission and devotion to Allah is in his own interest. Allah is supreme in glory. He is self sufficient. He is free of all needs.\nThe queen was lodged in another building of the palace. To make the queen see the fallacy of outward appearance the floor of the palace was made of slabs of smooth glass that glistened like water. When she was brought into the palace she thought it was water, and tucked up her clothes to pass through it, showing her bare feet and ankles. Sulayman told her the real fact. She then realised that she had been wrongly worshipping the creation of God, the sun, deceived by outward appearance, instead of worshipping the creator. At once she submitted herself to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, whom Sulayman worshipped.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 27:82]\nThe literal meaning of dabbah is slowly moving, crawling animal; beast of burden. Generally all commentators have chosen the word \"beast\" and interpreted the phrase dabbatan minal ard as the beast coming forth as the first sign of the day of judgement, touching the believers with the staff of Musa and marking the faces of the disbelievers with the seal of Sulayman. The last portion of this verse says that \"he\" who shall be brought forth from the earth will speak to the unjust that they did not believe with sure conviction in the signs of Allah, so it should be translated as an alive created being. The following note of Aqa Mahdi Puya correctly interprets the true meaning of this verse.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nRead verse 82 in the light of the commentary of verse 110 of Ali Imran wherein Allah addresses the best group raised among men to enjoin good and to prevent them from doing evil and mischief. In the end, before the final judgement is to be passed, the alive created being who will be brought forth from the earth to speak to the people should be of the same class and category, a human being of utmost accomplishments duly privileged to address the good as well as the wicked people. It is stated in the next verse that a group of disbelievers from every people will be gathered together before the day of resurrection.

The shepherds were drawing water for their own flocks but none drew water for the girls. These two girls were Safura and Safra, daughters of prophet Shu-ayb, who was very old and could not come to give water to the flocks which compelled the young ladies to go out but because of their modesty and personal nobility they could not thrust themselves into the crowd of males.\n"

On this, Shu-ayb replied that it was not in return that he served food, but as his custom to welcome and receive a guest. Musa then accepted the food.\n"

Irving's Succ. of Mohd., and says that at the time of going to Siffin, the army made a halt at a place where there was no water. Imam Ali, with some of his warriors, went in search of water. In a nearby monastery, a monk informed him that water is available at a place five miles away from there. Not only the soldiers but the horses and other beasts of burden were so thirsty that there was no possibility of taking them to the pointed out place. The Imam asked his men to dig the earth on a particular spot. After some digging a huge rock appeared. All the men, who could gather round the rock, did their best to lift and remove it, but the rock did not move an inch. Then the Imam, who had once lifted the door of the fort of Khaybar, put his hand under the rock, lifted it and threw it several feet away. There was abundant water under the earth covered by the rock. The monk asked Ali if he was a prophet. Ali said: \"No. I am the successor of the last prophet of Allah.\" The monk said: \"It is written in our holy books that there is a well in this vicinity but none save a prophet of Allah or a divinely chosen successor will discover it. Now I become a Muslim.\" He took part in the battle of Siffin and was martyred.\nAt the time of departure Ali covered the well with the earth. While returning from the battle Ali asked his men if they could find the well again. They thought it was easy, but in spite of extensive search they could not. Ali informed them that the well would remain hidden till the day of resurrection .\n"

He ordered some lions and other animals to be brought and Musa to be presented in chains. When Musa was brought and turned towards wild beasts they began to wag their tails and lick Musa's feet. Firawn was surprised and said that he had never seen such a person. Then Musa turned his face to the throne and Firawn recognised him and said: \"Did we not nourish you and brought you up?\" He ordered Musa to be beheaded by the executioner. When the executioner raised his sword on Musa, Jibrail caused the sword to cut the executioner himself and thereafter whoever attempted to slay Musa was himself beheaded. At last, Firawn ordered Musa to be released.\nMusa showed his hand shining as a bright star and said that this is my sign of being a prophet and then he threw his staff which turned into a big snake and opened its wide mouth big enough to swallow Firawn sitting on his throne.\nFirawn got frightened and ran out requesting Musa to hold back the snake. He held it, and it came back to its original state of an ordinary stick.\nImam Ali said:\nBy Allah I see Musa with his large arms, clad in a woollen shirt, his waist tied with a rope, his shoes made of mule's skin in his feet, his staff in his hand, standing on the door of Firawn and inviting him to declare his belief in the Lord of the worlds.\"\nThis verse also contains the prophecy of the fall of Makka when the Holy Prophet and Ali entered the city and Ali removed the idols in Ka-bah by standing on the shoulders of the Holy Prophet.\n"

His fear of sins was such that he never rejoiced over any gain nor grieved over any loss, even at the death of his children.\nIt is said that whenever he passed over any vegetation they used to disclose their respective properties latent in them.

The fifth year of Hijra was a critical year in the history of early Islam. The pagans of Makka, the Jews and bedouin Arabs entered into an unholy alliance against Islam, and came with a force of 10000 men in the month of Shawwal and besieged Madina. The hypocrites among the Muslims in Madina were in secret league with the invading army.

He who is a friend of our enemies is not our friend, even if he claims to be attached with us, nor do we accept him as our ally and follower.\"\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq said:\n\"If the heart of a person is wrapped up in the fascination of anything other than the presence of Allah at the time of prayer he is to be considered as worshipping that thing, not Allah.\"\nAbu Mu-mur Jamil bin Uwaris, an idol worshipper of Makka, was known among the disbelievers as the \"man with two hearts\" because he claimed that on account of his vast knowledge and wisdom he could understand men and matters more clearly and correctly than the Holy Prophet; but after the battle of Badr, while running away from the battlefield Abu Sufyan noticed that he had one of his shoes in his hand to which fact he drew his attention. Abu Mu-mur realized his folly because all the time he was thinking that both the shoes were on his feet. Then the myth of his \"two hearts in one breast\" was broken and people came to know that he was an ordinary man.\nIn the market of Akkaz Zayd bin Harith was being sold as a slave. The Holy Prophet purchased him and adopted him as his son. The father of Zayd was a man of means. When he came to know that his kidnapped son was sold as a slave, he approached Abu Talib to obtain the freedom of Zayd from his nephew. The Holy Prophet at once set him free and gave him permission to go with his father, but Zayd decided to remain with the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet asked the people to bear witness that from that day Zayd was his son and he was his father. Then he married his cousin Zaynab, a very beautiful young woman, to Zayd. It so happened that they could not live happily together. Zayd divorced Zaynab. To save Zaynab from the misery of a divorcee Allah commanded the Holy Prophet to marry Zaynab. According to pagan formula when a man wanted to get rid of his wife without making her free to remarry, he simply said to her: \"You are to me as the back of my mother.\" Likewise an adopted son was treated as a natural son. It was this crudity of the pagan morals that, upon the Holy Prophet's marrying the divorced wife of his freed man Zayd, who was also his adopted son, gave rise to a great deal of hostile criticism. Islam abolished these widespread foolish customs. In Islam, according to verse 23 of Nisa, those who have been \"wives of your sons proceeding from your loins\" are within the prohibited degrees of marriage, and this does not apply to adopted sons. Adoption in the technical sense is not allowed in Muslim law.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIf there is absolute submission to the will of Allah in the heart of a man, there cannot be any room for ghayrallah (other than Allah) in it.\nSawda daughter of Zum-a.\n"

The word awla refers to mawla, the term the Holy Prophet used for himself and Ali ibn abi Talib at Ghadir Khum (see commentary of Ma-idah: 67). This verse decisively establishes the superior authority of the Holy Prophet over the selves or souls of all the believers. Even the considerations, pertaining to the nearest blood relatives are subjected to his superior authority. There is a complete surrender of self to the commands of the Holy Prophet in all material and spiritual matters.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"None among you can ever be a true believer unless he accepts and obeys me as his master.\"\nThe wives of the Holy Prophet are the mothers of the believers.\nIt is a well known tradition that the Holy Prophet gave Ali the authority to divorce any of his (the Holy Prophet's) wives. According to Imam Muhammad bin Hasan al Qa-im the Holy Prophet said:\n\"O Abul Hasan, Allah has bestowed honour on my wives, but if they disobey the laws and commands of Allah, made known through me, they come out of the sacred range of the divine grace. At anytime, after me, if any of them rebel against you, you have the authority to divorce her on my behalf.\"\nPlease refer to the commentary of Anfal: 75 for \"blood relations are nearer one to another in the book of Allah than the believers and muhajirs\" Refer to the commentary of Ma-idah: 67 for \"the prophet has a greater or nearer claim over the believers than they have on their own selves.\" Also refer to the commentary of Anfal: 24 and 27.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThis verse makes known the basis of the wilayah and imamah (the absolute authority of the Holy Prophet and of Ali as declared at Ghadir Khum) over the believers.\nRefer to the commentary of Anfal: 75 to know the principle of inheritance-he who is closer and nearer to him in wisdom and character should be his spiritual heir, and the closest relation in blood should inherit his property, therefore he in whom both \"nearnesses\" are combined should inherit his position as well as his property. Also refer to the introduction of surah al Bara-at for the closeness to the point of indivisible oneness between the Holy Prophet and Ali ibn abi Talib.\n\"His wives are their mothers\" has been mentioned to say \"you should not marry his widows after him at any time\" in verse 53 of this surah. There is no significance in it other than the fact that whatever is associated with the Holy Prophet is to be respected and honoured even if the thing or person possesses no merits of his own just like the \"black stone\" which was fixed by Ibrahim and Ismail in the house of Allah by His command.\nSafiya daughter of Hayy ibn Akhtab.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 33:9]\nVerses 20, 22 and 23 and this verse refer to the battle of Khandaq. The surah Al Ahzab takes its name from the army of the allied clans which came against the Muslims in the 5th year of the Hijrah. The pagans of Makkah, the Jews and bedouin Arabs entered into an unholy alliance came with a force of 10000 men and besieged the Muslim community in Madina. This battle has been described in detail in the commentary of Baqarah: 214 and 251. A trench (khandaq) was dug round Madina, as advised by Salman, by the order of the Holy Prophet. When Ali ibn abi Talib killed Amr bin Abdwud in single combat the whole army of 10000 men went back to Makka without further fighting. This type of unique retreat after the defeat of one warrior never happened in the history except in the time of Prophet Dawud when he killed Jalut. Ali's triumph became so decisive that the pagans of Makka or their allies never made any attempt thereafter to attack Muslims in Madina.\nIt is reported that at the time of digging the trench a stone in the earth was found which neither could be removed nor broken. The people went to the Holy Prophet to seek his help. He came and struck it thrice with an axe, each time a flashing spark sparkled from the stone and people saw the glimpses of Syria, Madina and Yeman one after another. The stone was broken. The Holy Prophet told them Allah would grant the Muslims victories over those towns. The weak in faith and the hypocrites, who were expecting certain end of the Holy Prophet, openly accused him of telling morale boasting lies to keep the people in delusion. There was no food in the city. Jabir bin Abdullah had a lamb and a little quantity of corn. The Holy Prophet asked him to prepare whatever food he could from those provisions. The people were invited to eat the prepared food in batches of ten. They all came as advised and ate to their full satisfaction, yet the quantity remained as it was. During the nearly 3 weeks blockade the hypocrites left no stone unturned to demoralise the people through rumours and to convince them that the best course was to go to their homes and save themselves from utter annihilation.\nThe enemy was struck dumb with astonishment because this mode of defence was not known to the Arabs, and they were at a loss to understand how to overcome the difficulty. At length a select party of the besiegers' horsemen found out a narrow part of the ditch which was not guarded. Amr bin Abdwud, Nawafal bin Abdullah, Darar bin Khattab and Ikrima bin Abu Jahl succeeded in leaping over the trench. Amr, reining forward towards the Muslims, challenged them to single combat. What followed after this challenge has been mentioned in the commentary of al Baqarah : 214 and 251.\nWhen Ali and Amr stood face to face Amr said to Ali: \"By God, I do not like to put you to death because your father was my friend, and I enjoyed many a feast at his dinner table.\" Ali replied: \"There could be no friendship between belief and disbelief, so by Allah, I am here to kill you.\"\nAmr was described by the Holy Prophet as the personification of infidelity, nevertheless even such a person had a moral sense to give respect and have consideration for the son of the man who treated him well, but the so-called followers of the Holy Prophet who not only guided them to the right path but also took them out from the darkness of ignorance and depths of degradation to the light of civilisation, harassed, persecuted and killed his children in Karbala and after Karbala till his last son and inheritor Imam Mahdi al Qa-im was taken up by Allah, as Isa was taken up to heaven, to make him invisible.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"It is a struggle between faith and infidelity, the embodiment of faith shall crush the entirety of infidelity.\"\nAt last the voice of Ali, pronouncing Allahu Akbar, was heard, which was a signal of his victory. The divine decree (There is no god save Allah; Muhammad is the messenger of Allah and Ali is his supporter) which the Holy Prophet saw inscribed in letters of celestial light on heavens in the night of mi-raj (see commentary of Bani Israil: 1) was found by him fulfilled on every such occasion.\nBeholding the fate of their renowned champion, his comrades in the enterprise rushed back to escape, spurred their horses and crossed the ditch except Nawfal who fell in the ditch.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"The victory of Ali on the day of the ditch is much more in worth than the devotional worship performed by the created beings of both the worlds (seen and unseen) till the day of judgement.\"\nThen there was a piercing blast of the cold east wind, the enemy's tents were torn up, their fires were extinguished, the sand and rain beat in their faces, and they were terrified by the signs against them.\nAll the above noted events and those mentioned in the commentary of al Baqarah: 214 and 251 are mentioned in Tarikh al Khamis; Madarij al Nabuwah; Mustadrak of Hakim, Firduws al Akhbar Rawdat al Ahbab; Izalatal Khifa and Habib al Siyar and the histories by Ibn Athir and Abul Fida.\nJuwari-ah daughter of Harith Mustalaqa.\nIt is reported that Abu Bakr and Umar bin Khattab had expressed their displeasure to their daughters and reprimanded them for their unjustified demands and their insolent behaviour. Once Ali tried to put fear of Allah in their hearts but A-isha lost her temper and used harsh words to insult him. Then and their the Holy Prophet gave authority to Ali to divorce any of his wives on his behalf. See commentary of At Tahrim: 1 to 5.\nBukhari in his commentary of Tahrim in his Sahih record several traditions as related by Umar stating that the two women who were insolent and haughty towards the Holy Prophet were A-isha and Hafsa. It refers to her address to the Holy Prophet: \"I smell maghafir (a kind of flower having a very bad odour) from you.\" She said this in order to prevent him from visiting the house of Zaynab and eating honey there.\nWhen some malevolent persons falsely accused Mariyah mother of Ibrahim, A-isha supported the accusers and tried in vain to confirm the false blame, but Allah absolved them (the Prophet and Mariyah) and saved them from injustice through Imam Ali. Those who want to know the details of the unhappy incident should refer to the account of Mariyah in Hakim's Mustadrak, vol. 4, p. 30; or Dhahabi's Talkhis al Mustadrak.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nDue to the unbecoming, envious and avaricious behaviour of the wives referred to in verses 28 to 34 they have not been included in the clause of purification of Ahl ul Bayt in verse 33, in which the highest degree of purification has been bestowed only on the Ahl ul Bayt. This is the reason that in all these verses the wives of the Holy Prophet are referred to in personal plural pronoun in feminine gender, but in the clause of purification the pronoun is plural in masculine gender, just as in verse 73 of Hud. In verse 5 of at Tahrim it is stated that the Holy Prophet had discretionary power to divorce any of his wife, and if he did so Allah would give him better women as his wives in place of the existing wives. When evident unbecoming misconduct has been proved against the wives, the element of rijs (pollution) is established, therefore as they could be divorced and no more be the Holy Prophet's wives, they were not included in the Ahl ul Bayt.\nAs the wives of the Holy Prophet they were expected not only to display refinement, decency and decorum but also imbibe moral and spiritual excellence in their character because of their close and constant association with the Holy Prophet; and if they did not, their punishment in the hereafter would be doubled (greater in degree), because as the wives of the Holy Prophet they should have been models of piety for other women. Refer to the commentary of Nur: 26.\nTo the good and obedient wives Allah will give double reward and a honourable sustenance.\nIt has been made clear to the wives of the Holy Prophet that mere association with him does not give them any privilege unless they obey the Holy Prophet and safeguard themselves against evil. Although they have been declared \"the mothers of the believers\", yet they are warned not to be too friendly lest some one is moved with desire. In this there is guidance for all women that they should keep all men at arm's length-not to give even a slight unconscious indication of possible complaisance.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 33:10]\nThe sight of the enemy who surrounded the city round the trench was frightful. All the Muslims save the Holy Prophet, his Ahl ul Bayt and their followers feared that they might not be able to stand the trial and would be slaughtered and destroyed. \"The hearts jumped to the throats\" is expressive of cowardice.\n\"They came on you from above you\" refers to the heathens and \"from below you\" refers to the hypocrites and the weak-hearted wavering converts.\nThe word muminin in verse 11 refers to those who posed themselves as believers but were not in fact true faithfuls. Their insincerity and false guise became known when Amr threw an open challenge but none of the companions came forward to meet him in single combat because they were shaken by a frightening terror.\nAs stated in the commentary of verse 9 the Holy Prophet had seen clear signs of victory, but the hypocrites and the insincere believers accused him and the true believers of keeping the Muslims in delusive hopes.\nYathrib is the ancient name of Madina. The disaffected hypocrites and the insincere spread defeatist rumours and persuaded the Muslims to leave the scene of the impending battle and withdraw for the defence of their homes, although their homes were not exposed to enemy attack. So prone and ever-ready were they to every act of hostility against Islam that if the enemy had been able to penetrate into the city, they, sitting on the fence, would have joined the forces of the invaders at once, although, after the battle of Uhad, certain men who had deserted the Holy Prophet, made a covenant with Allah and His Prophet that they would behave better next time. See commentary of Ali Imran: 121, 122, 128, 140 to 142, 144, 151 to 156, 159, 166 to 168 and Anfal: 16.\nImam Ali said:\n\"On which day (can) I run away from death? The day which is decreed (or) the day which is not decreed!\".\nMost of the companions of the Holy Prophet who were weak in faith fell easy prey to the machination of the clever hypocrites, as they did in the battles of Badr and Uhad (see verses of Ali Imran and Anfal noted above) and afterwards in Hunayn (see commentary of Bara-at: 25 to 27). In times of danger they would look to the Holy Prophet and Ali for protection, and keep themselves snugly away from the fight. When the danger is past, they would come and brag and wrangle and show their covetousness and greed for gains. Even any good they might have done was obliterated\nbecause there was no sincere motive behind it except envy, greed and cowardice.\nVerse 20 gives a vivid picture of the psychology of the most of the companions of the Holy Prophet. Even when the enemy had gone they were so much confused in their minds that they secretly decided to run away from the city and take refuge in the desert if the enemy made another attack.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"They would fight but little\" shows that the companions made almost no contribution to the mission of the Holy Prophet. Even a commentator like Allama Yusuf Ali (who has not mentioned the Ahl ul Bayt at all in his entire commentary) admits in his note (3685) that \"Ali particularly distinguished himself in many fights, wearing the prophet's own sword and armour.\"\n"

But on the occasion of the siege by the Quraysh and their allies they intrigued with the enemies and treacherously aided them. The Banu Qurayza were filled with terror and dismay when Madina was free from the Quraysh danger. They shut themselves in their fortress about three or four miles to the east of Madina.\nAhul Fida and Tabari in their histories and Hirwi in Habib al Siyar say that soon after his return from the battle of Khandaq, while laying aside his armour, the Holy Prophet was washing his hands and face in the house of his beloved daughter Fatimah whom he used to visit before going to his own quarter on return from an expedition or excursion the angel Jibrail brought a command from Allah to proceed immediately against the Qurayza Jews.\nThe Holy Prophet instantly sent Ali with his standard, and himself following with his army laid siege to the fortress of the Jews. The Holy Prophet himself went near the gate of their fortress and asked them to surrender. They did not. Had they done as suggested by the Holy Prophet they would have enjoyed the fair and lenient terms given to the tribe of Banu Quinuqa It is said that at the command of the Holy Prophet the grove of the trees near the walls of the fortress moved over to a place away from it so as to give shelter to the Muslim army.\nAt last, after twenty five days they offered to surrender, if Sad bin Mu-az, the chief of their allies-the Bani Aws- might be appointed to decide their fate. The Holy Prophet agreed. Sad decreed that the male captives should be put to sword, women and children be sold as slaves and their goods be confiscated and divided among the besiegers. This decision was given by Sad in the light of the verses 13 and 14 of Deuteronomy 20:\n\"You shall put all its males to the sword, but you may take the women, the dependants, and the cattle for yourselves.\"\nPlease refer to Deuteronomy 20: 10 to 18.\n"

He married her fifteen years before he made known his prophetship; their marriage life lasted for twenty five years, and their love and harmony was ideal. During her life he had no other wife. When she died the Holy Prophet observed \"the year of grief\". He would probably never have married again, as he was most abstemious in his physical life, but for two considerations which governed his later marriages-(i) compassion and clemency; (ii) help in his duties of prophetship.\nSome of his wives were gentle and faithful; some were envious and avaricious, whom the Holy Prophet, as commanded by Allah in this verse, offered to set free in a goodly manner.\nAfter hearing the Holy Prophet's declaration Ummi Salima stood up and said: \"I have chosen Allah and His Prophet\". Then verse 29 was revealed. It refers to those wives who did not covet for worldly gains but rejoiced in the honour they had as the wives of the Holy Prophet. For such wives there is a great reward from Allah in the hereafter. Most of the commentators say that this verse was revealed because of the persistent demand of his wives for a high standard of living which was beyond the means of the Holy Prophet.

Regular prayer (seeking nearness to Allah) and regular charity (doing good to fellow-creatures) are mentioned as specially symbolical of the religion of Allah, Islam.\nThe first command in this verse \"stay in your houses\" was violated by A-isha when she went to Iraq to organise a mischievous campaign against Ali about whom the Holy Prophet said:\n\"O Ali, you are to me as Harun was to Musa. You are my brother in this world and the hereafter. Your flesh is my flesh, your blood is my blood. You and me are from one and the same light.\"\nIn his sermon at Ghadir Khum (see commentary of Ma-idah: 67) he invoked Allah to be a friend of those who loved Ali and be an enemy of those who opposed Ali.\nBukhari has recorded in the chapter \"What happened in the houses of the Prophet's wives\" in the book \"Jihad and Travel\" of his Sahih, vol. 2, p. 125, that while delivering an address from the pulpit, the Holy Prophet pointed towards A-isha's house and said: \"Here lies the scandal; here lies the scandal; here lies the scandal, where the horn of Shaytan would be rising.\" In the words of Sahih Muslim: \"The Prophet came out of the house of A-isha and remarked: \"Here is the head of infidelity where the horn of Shaytan will rise.\" Refer to Sahih Muslim, vol. 2,0.502.\n\"Verily Allah intends to keep off from you uncleanness, O you Ahl ul Bayt and purify you with a thorough purification\" is a separate verse revealed on a particular occasion but placed here. Please refer to Aqa Mahdi Puya's note in the commentary of verses 28 to 32.\nThe time, occasion and people concerned in connection with the revelation of the above noted verse have been discussed and made known in many authentic books of the Muslim scholars.\nThe one and only reference available to the commentators is the event of the blanket (Hadith al Kisa).\nThe \"event of the blanket\" has been written by the following authors whom the Muslim Ummah acclaim with one voice.\n(1) Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal (241 H) \"Musnad\" (Egypt: 131 H) pages 259, 285, 292.\n(2) Muslim bin Hajjaj Nayshapuri (261 H) Sahih Muslim\" (Egypt: 1349) vol. 4, page 116.\n(3) Abi Isa Muhammad Tirmidhi (275 or 279 H) \"Sahih Tirmidhi\" (Sharah ibnul Arabi) (Egypt: 1352 H) vol. 13 pages 200, 248.\n(4) Ahmed ibn Shu-ayb Nisa-i (303 H) \"Khasa-is\" (Egypt: 1348 H) page 4.\n(5) Ibn Jarir Tabari (310 H) \"Tafsir Tabari\" (Jama ul Bayan fi Tafsir il Quran) (Egypt: 1331 H) vol.22, page 5.\n(6) Sulayman bin Ahmad Al Tibrani (360 H) \"Al Mu-jam Al Saghir\" (Dehli: 1311 H), page 34, 75.\n(7) Hakim Nayshapuri (405 H) \"Al Mustadrak\" (Hyderabad Deccan: 1334 H), pages 146, 147, 148.\n(8) Yusuf bin Abdullah ibni Abdul Birr (463 H) \"Al Isti-ab\" (Hyderabad Deccan: 1346 H),\nvol. 2, page 460.\n    Ali bin Ahmad Al Wahidi (468 H) \"Asbab ul Nuzul\" (Egypt: 1315 H) pages 266, 267. \nTirmidhi, Ibn Jarir Tabari, Hakim and Tibrani have related from Ummi Salima that when this verse was revealed the Holy Prophet was under a blanket or mantle along with Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn, and he declared that his family consisted of only these persons. Ummi Salima, his wife, within whose quarters the revelation came, asked permission to be included in the group under the blanket, but she was politely refused permission. The group is known ever since with the epithet \"panjtan pak\" or \"the holy group of five\". These are the persons who were compared by the Holy Prophet with the ark of Nuh wherein those who embarked were saved, while those who sought shelter elsewhere were drowned. Refer to Tafsir Azizi by Shah Abdul Aziz and Tafsir Durr al Manthur by Jalal al Din al Suyuti. In Yanabi al Mawaddat, page 87, Shaykh al Islam writes that A-isha said: \"Ayah al Tat-hir refers only to the Holy Prophet, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn. No wife of his is included.\" On page 280 of volume two of Sharah Nuwi of Sahih Muslim it is written that when Zayd bin Arqam was asked whether the wives of the Holy Prophet are included in the Ahl ul Bayt, he said: \"By Allah the wives of the Holy Prophet cannot be included in the Ahl ul Bayt at all, because after the pronouncement of divorce the wives are reverted to their parent; and, moreover, sadqah (charity) is prohibited to be given to the Ahl ul Bayt.\" Also please refer to the commentary of Shura: 42 and Ali Imran : 61 for further confirmation and proofs.\nSome commentators report this tradition through A-isha who says that this event took place in her house. So two wives of the Holy Prophet have confirmed that they both were not given permission by the Holy Prophet to come under the blanket, so they could never be described as Ahl ul Bayt.\nThalabi reports that when A-isha was asked as to why she violated the command of Allah \"to stay in your houses\" by going to the battle of Jamal against Ali, she said:\n\"It was my fate. I saw the Holy Prophet taking Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husain under his mantle and heard him saying: 'O Allah, these are my Ahl ul Bayt. Keep off impurity from them.' I asked him: 'Am I not of your Ahl ul Bayt?' He said: 'Go away from here. You are not of my Ahlul Bayt.'\"\nAbu Dawud and Malik relate from Anas that for six months after the revelation of this verse every morning, while going for fajr salat, the Holy Prophet used to recite this verse at the door of Fatimah's house.\nIn verse 73 of Hud Sara is addressed as Ahli Bayt, not as the wife of Ibrahim but as the mother of prophet Is-haq, because the state of being a wife of a prophet gives no privilege to a woman as stated above and clearly indicated by the Holy Prophet himself, and decisively proved by the condemnation of the wives of Nuh and Lut.\nInnama implies the determined decision or will of Allah. Although the decision of a created being may not take effect at all, but the will of Allah takes immediate effect. There cannot be a slightest gap of time or space in the will of Allah taking effect. When He commands: \"Be\"; it becomes. Refer to Baqarah: 117; Nahl: 40 Maryolm: 35; Ya Sin 83; Mumin: 68 and Qamar 50. It is not only the will of Allah but the declaration of its effect. Since the Ahl ul Bayt have been thoroughly purified, they remain thoroughly purified for ever. The prayer of Ibrahim in Baqarah: 127 to 129 is prayed to continue the excellence in themselves and in their descendants mentioned in Baqarah: 124. When a quality or attribute is described or mentioned in indefinite sense it refers to the perfect possibility. The purity in this verse is absolute purity. Polytheism (shirk) is described in the Quran as impurity and also the greatest iniquity (refer to Luqman : 13). Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 124 for the condition that imamah is not bestowed on those who have ever (even once in their lives) worshipped any ghayrallah. All the companions of the Holy Prophet and his wives were polytheists before embracing Islam. Only the Holy Prophet, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn were at that time free from the dirt of shirk, therefore they alone could be throughly purified.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n(i) Innama (verily or only) signifies exclusive distinction. To emphasise this exclusiveness, the second object of the verb yudh-hiba (keep off)-the phrase ankum (from you)-has been put before the first object rijs (uncleanness); and for further emphasis, the phrase Ahl ul Bayt has been mentioned to explain the pronoun ankum (from you). The grammatical structure of the whole clause indicates that this a unique privilege or distinction granted to the Ahl ul Bayt only, excluding all others.\n(ii)\nThe verb yuridu implies that the continuous will or intention of Allah is His creative will or intention, not legislative. To interpret the will as the legislative will as in Ma-idah: 6, distorts the whole fabric of the verse and renders meaningless the exclusive particle and the constructional arrangement. Even then it means that only the Ahl ul Bayt exclusively achieved the standard.\n(iii) This verse is a preface to verses 77 to 79 of al Waqi-ah: \"Verily this is an honourable (Karim) Quran, in a hidden (preserved) book, which no one can touch save the purified.\" (Refer to page 3.)\n(iv) The excellences of Ahl ul Bayt have been openly demonstrated in the event of mubahilah (refer to the commentary of Ali Imran : 61).\n(v) The Ahl ul Bayt had only been thoroughly purified by Allah because of their total submission to Allah's will and their state of being always in communion with Allah.\nThe event of revelation of this verse as reported by Jabir bin Abdullah Ansari, one of the most reliable companions of the Holy Prophet has been mentioned in \"Awalim al Ulum\" by Shaykh Abdullah bin Nurullah Al-Bahrayni and is reproduced here:-\nIn the name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful. It is reported by Jabir bin Abdullah Ansari that Fatimah Zahra said;\nOne day my father, the messenger of Allah, came into (my house),\nand said \"Fatimah! Peace be on you.\" \"Peace be on you too.\" I replied.\n\"I am not feeling well.\" He said.\n\"May Allah keep you safe from weakness, O my father.\" I prayed.\n\"Fatimah! Please bring the Yamani blanket and cover me with it.\" He said.\nSo I brought the Yamani blanket and covered him with it. I turned my eyes upon his face. It was shining bright like a full moon in its full glory and splendour.\nThen, not a moment passed before my son, Hasan, walked in and said:\n\"Peace be on you, mother.\"\n\"Peace be on you too, my dearest darling\" I answered.\n\"I breathe the pure aroma of the messenger of Allah, my grandfather, coming from you!\" He observed.\n\"True; your grandfather is under the blanket.\" I confirmed.\nHasan went near his grandfather (covered with the blanket) and said:\n\"Peace be on you, grandfather, the messenger of Allah, may I join you under the blanket?\"\n\"Peace be on you, my son, my companion at the spring of Kawthar, come in.\"\nHe went inside the blanket.\nThen, not a moment passed, before my son, Husayn, walked in and said: \"Peace be on you, mother.\" \"Peace be on you too, my dearest darling\" I answered .\n\"I breathe the pure aroma of the messenger of Allah, my grandfather, coming from you!\" He observed .\n\"True, your grandfather and your brother are under the blanket.\" I confirmed.\nHusayn went near the blanket (under which his grandfather was resting with his brother) and said:\n\"Peace be on you grandfather, the choice of Allah, may I join you both under the blanket ?\"\n\"Peace be on you, my son, the saviour of my people, come in.\"\nHe went inside the blanket.\nIn that instant Abul Hasan. Amir al Muminin, Ali ibn abi Talib, stepped in and said:\n\"Peace be on you, O the daughter of the messenger of Allah!\"\n\"Peace be on you too, Abul Hasan, Amir al Muminin.\" I answered.\n\"Fatimah, I breathe the pure aroma of my brother, the son of my uncle, the messenger of Allah, coming from you!\" He observed.\n\"True, he is under the blanket with your sons\" I confirmed.\nAli went near the blanket and said:\n\"Peace be on you, the messenger of Allah, may I join you (all) under the blanket?\"\n\"Peace be on you, my brother, the executor of my will, my successor, my standard bearer, come in.\"\nAli went inside the blanket.\nThen I went near the blanket and said:\n\"Peace be on you, my father, the messenger of Allah, may I join you (all), under the blanket?\"\n\"Peace be on you; my daughter my darling, come in.\"\nI went inside the blanket.\nAs soon as all of us united under the blanket, my father, the messenger of Allah, held the two ends of the blanket and raised his right hand toward the heaven and said:\n\"O Allah! These are my Ahl ul Bayt, very special to me, my near and dear ones, my own flesh and blood; whoso annoys them disturbs me; whoso makes them sad makes me unhappy. I make war on those who carry on hostilities against them; I am well disposed towards those who make their peace with them; I oppose those who run counter to them; I favour those who love them. They are from me and I am from them. So send Thy blessings, benefits, mercy, protection and favours on me and on them, and keep off from them uncleanliness, and purify them with a thorough purification.\"\nThereupon The Almighty and the Glorious Allah said: \"O My angels and the dwellers of the heavens, verily I have not created the indeclinable sky, the levelled earth, the bright moon, the resplendent sun, the rotating cosmic system, the flowing seas, and the sailing ship, but for the sake of and in the love of the five souls lying underneath the blanket.\"\nThe trusted Jibrail asked:\n\"O Lord! Who are underneath the blanket?\" The Almighty and the Glorious replied:\n\"They are the 'Ahl ul Bayt' of the Prophet, the custodians of the message; they are-Fatimah, her father, her husband and her sons.\"\nJibrail (submissively) asked:\n\"O Lord! May I descend on the earth and be the sixth with them?\"\n\"Yes. I give you permission,\" said Allah.\nThe trusted angel, Jibrail, came down (on the earth), and said:\n\"Peace be on you, O the messenger of Allah. The Highest High says: \"Peace be on you. And distinguishes you with greetings and blessings.\nHe tells you:\n'In the name of My majesty and glory, verily, I have not created the indeclinable sky, the levelled earth, the bright moon, the resplendent sun, the rotating cosmic system, the flowing seas, and the sailing ship, but for your sake and in your love.'\nAnd He has also given me permission to be with you. So may I have your permission O the messenger of Allah.\"\nThe messenger of Allah replied: \"Peace be on you, O the custodian of Allah's revelation, come in and join (us).\"\nJibrail came in and joined us under the blanket.\nHe told my father: \"Verily, Allah has sent a revelation to you. He said:\n'Verily Allah's wish is but to keep off from you uncleanness, O Ahl ul Bayt, and to purify you (with) a thorough purification.'\"\nAli asked my father: \"O messenger of Allah, tell us that which makes our assembly under this blanket an event of surpassing excellence before Allah.\"\nThe Prophet replied:\n\"In the name of He who sent me as a truthful prophet, and chose me as a redeemer to convey His message, I declare that no assembly of our followers and devotees, on the earth, where this event is narrated shall spend a single moment but the mercy of Allah will envelop them, then and there; and countless angels of Allah shall pray for the remission of their sins till the group of the faithful disperse.\"\nAli declared:\n\"Well then, by the Lord of the Ka-bah, we have attained our end, and have been rendered successful, so also our followers!\"\nThe Holy Prophet said again:\n\"O Ali! In the name of He who sent me as a truthful Prophet, and chose me as a redeemer to convey His message, I declare that in any of the assemblies of our followers and devotees, on the earth, where this event is narrated, there would not be a grief-stricken among them, but Allah dispels his worries; nor there would be a downcast, among them, but Allah disperses his sorrows; nor would there be a needy, among them, but Allah meets his de"

On several occasions the Holy Prophet had said that every Muslim man and Muslim woman must cultivate the following virtues:\n(i) Faith, hope and trust in Allah, and in His benevolent administration of the whole universe;\n(ii) devotion and service in practical life;\n(iii) love and practice of the teachings of Islam in thought and intention, word and deed;\n(iv) patience in suffering and constancy in right endeavour;\n(v) humility, the avoidance of an attitude of arrogance and superiority;\n(vi) financial help to the poor and less fortunate fellow-beings;\n(vii) self denial,\n(viii) purity in sex life, purity in motive, thought, word and deed;\n(ix) constant attention to Allah's commands,\n(x) safeguarding oneself against evil with full awareness of laws made by Allah.\nForgiveness and equal recompense are for both men and women.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 33:36]\nRefer to the commentary of verses 4, 5 and 28 to 32 of this surah about Zayd, Zaynab and the Holy Prophet. Zayd's marriage with the Holy Prophet's cousin Zaynab daughter of Jahsh was celebrated in Makka eight years before the hijrat. At the time of their marriage when she was informed by the Holy Prophet she did not like the proposal, so her brother Abdullah bin Jahsh; and both of them, according to Imam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir, wanted to exercise their freedom of choice in this matter, then this verse was revealed. We must not put our own wisdom in competition with Allah's wisdom. We must accept it loyally, and do the best we can to carry it out. We must make our will consonant to the will of Allah. Also refer to the commentary of Nisa: 65. Zaynab the high-born could not reconcile herself with Zayd. Both were good believers, and both loved the Holy Prophet; but there was mutual incompatibility and this proved to be the cause of separation between them. Zayd wished to divorce her. The Holy Prophet tried his best to prevent separation between them, because Zaynab's reputation would be ruined, but as marriage should be according to Allah's plan, a source of happiness, not torture, Islam permits the bond of marriage to be dissolved, provided that all interests concerned are safeguarded. Refer to the commentary of Nisa : 3 for polygamy and al Baqarah: 227 to 237 for divorce. After the divorce Zaynab's misery as a widow began to disturb the family of Banu Hashim. In fact, Zaynab's parents wanted to give Zaynab's hand to the Holy Prophet right from the beginning, but at the Holy Prophet's command she was married to Zayd. Now she, and her brothers and other members of the family asked the Holy Prophet to marry her. Then the verse 37 was revealed and the Holy Prophet married her. The issue of an adopted son has been dealt with in the commentary of verse 4 of this surah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"An adopted son is not the real son\", and all other Quranic injunctions are valid in all ages.\n\"You did fear the people\" implies that the right course should be followed, whether the people like it or not, as said in verse 54 of Ma-idah: \"They fear not the censure of the censurers.\"\nProphethood does not deprive the prophet and his family of essential human rights divinely legislated for all.\n"

The reason for his marriages, after the death of Khadijah Kubra has also been stated in the commentary of abovesaid verses.\nAmir Ali in Spirit of Islam says (on the authority of many Muslim historians like Tabari etcetera) that after the death of Khadijah Kubra with a view to cement his friendship Abu Bakr made an offer of his daughter A-isha to the Holy Prophet. At his persuasive solicitations the Holy Prophet consented. This was an act of Abu Bakr's characteristic foresight. With the example of Abu Bakr before him, Umar, also desirous of having a like influence in the close circle of the Holy Prophet, gave his daughter to him. Hafsa was a widow. Umar first offered her to Abu Bakr and then to Uthman but the offer was rejected by both, Umar mentioned this to the Holy Prophet, as a complaint, who, out of compassion, accepted her as his wife.\nSimilarly, he married other women mentioned in the commentary of verses 28 to 32, either out of compassion, or on account of clemency, or to help his mission.

The believers are also commanded to invoke Allah to send His blessings on him. The Muslims asked the Holy Prophet: \"How are we to seek blessings on you?\" He said: \"Say: 'O Allah, send blessings on Muhammad and on the al (children) of Muhammad.\"\nFakh al Din al Razi writes that the Ahl ul Bayt are at par with the Holy Prophet in five things (one of which is) in invoking the blessings of Allah during prayers, after each tashahud which, if not recited, renders the salat null and void. Bukhari writes in his Sahih, page 127, volume 3 (Egypt edition) that the Holy Prophet said: \"Say: 'O Allah send blessings on Muhammad and on ali Muhammad (Ah ul Bayt) just as You blessed Ibrahim and ali Ibrahim'.\"\nIbn Hajar Makki writes in his Sawa-iq al Muhriqah, on page 87, that the Holy Prophet warned the people not to send batar salawat (salawat which has lost the tail i.e. curtailed). When asked what a batar salawat was he replied: \"If you stop at 'Allahumma salli ala Muhammad' You should say: 'Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ali Muhammad'\"\nIn religious meetings and gatherings it has become a \"fashion\" to say in melodious accent: SALLALLAHU ALA YKA YA RASULLILLAH WA SALLAM ALA YKA YA HABIBALLAH which in the light of the abovenoted authentic traditions is deviation from the right path shown by Allah in this verse. When Allah Himself sends blessings (salawat) on the Holy Prophet as made clear by him in various traditions, if some one selects words not approved by the Holy Prophet, it can be described as hypocrisy, punishment of which is eternal damnation in the fire of hell.\nAhmad bin Hanbal writes in his Musnad, volume 6 page 323, that the Holy Prophet covered Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn with a blanket and said: \"O Allah these are my Abl ul Bayt so I invoke You to send Your blessings on Muhammad and ali Muhammad.\"\nMuslim has also related this in his Sahih, in part I of \"the book of prayers.\"\nAlso refer to Mushkil al Athar by Tahawi (volume 1, page 334), Kanz al Ummal by Ali Muttaqi (volume 7, page 103) and Tafsir Durr al Manthur by Jalaluddin al Suyuti in his interpretation of ayah al tat-hir. He has also quoted the well-known verse composed by Al Shafi-i:\n\"O Ahl ul Bayt of Allah's messenger, your love is a duty made obligatory upon us in the Quran. It is enough among your great privileges that whoever does not invoke Allah's blessings on you, his prayer (salat) is void.\"\nIbn Hajar also quoted these lines of Shafi-i on page 88 of his Sawa-iq al Muhriqah, in connection with his interpretation of verse 33 of Ahzab.\nIt is compulsory to recite salawat whenever the name of the Holy Prophet is mentioned.\nIf a believer really desires fulfilment of his or her supplication, salawat must be recited before and also at the end of the prayer because in that case whatever the prayer contains in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end will be accepted by Allah as the salawat has covered and encircled the whole supplication, and as salawat is always accepted by Allah (because He Himself recites salawat on the Holy Prophet) the entire prayer is accepted by Him.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe recitation of salawat implies that the believers should not worship the Holy Prophet as a deity. He is the most honoured servant of Allah for whom Allah sends His highest blessings, because he is the first and the foremost in submission and devotion to Allah. The Ahl ul Bayt have been included with him, by his command, because they are also equal to him in submission and devotion to Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 33:72]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAmanat means trust. There is no trust if the trustee has no power, and the trust implies that the giver of the trust expects that the trustee would use it according to the wish or will of the creator of the trust, and not otherwise.\nThe offer implies the unrestricted grace of Allah which reaches all beings in the heavens and the earth and in between them; and the refusal refers to their inability or lack of competency to carry out the responsibility. If haml (to bear) implies acceptance of the offer, then this verse means that the heavens, the earth and the mountains refused to accept the offer and man undertook the responsibility. According to some commentators haml, in this verse, implies \"failure in the fulfilment and bearing the consequences.\" Iniquity and ignorance of those who failed to fulfil the entrusted responsibility, pointed out in the last clause, refers, by inference, to those trustees who used the trust according to the will of the creator of the trust, and not otherwise. Therefore this verse implies the praise of those who fulfil the responsibility and denunciation of those who, on account of their iniquity and ignorance, fail to do so. The book of Allah and the Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet are the two most important trusts of Allah given to the Muslims, about which they will be questioned (see hadith al thaqalayn).\nDo not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Verily the ear, the eye and the heart, each shall be questioned.(Bani Israil: 36)\nThe trust is the viceregency of Allah (khilafat) given to man as a gift from the Lord to represent Him according to His will. If the last clause is taken as the failure of Adam then the verses of al Baqarah: 30 to 32 and 124 and Ali Imran: 33 and 34 become meaningless.\nIn Hashr: 21 the sending down of the Quran to the mountains is mentioned, and it is also mentioned therein that such parables are put forth in order to aid man to reflection. The heavens, the earth and the mountains submit themselves to the laws made by Allah. They have no free will. The first and foremost pre-requisite to accept the responsibility is freedom of choice which implies answerableness for all acts of thought and conduct. The trust referred to is the trust of free will or accountability. The evil ones among the human beings have betrayed the trust and brought punishment on themselves, but there are some chosen ones who have been endowed with divine wisdom to rise far above the common level of human abilities, to be the muqarrabin, the nearest ones to Allah as stated in Waqi-ah: 11 and 88. There can be no higher attainment than this for any creature.\nSee commentary of Baqarah: 30 to 34, according to which man (Adam) was taught the names (of the personalities of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt) which no created being, nor even the angels knew before. By making known \"these names\" Allah intended the highest destiny for man. He made him His vicegerent. To know the highest height man could rise refer to the commentary of Bani Israil: 1 and Najm: 2 to 9. The Holy Prophet, Ali, Fatimah and the eleven Imams in their progeny (see commentary of Baqarah: 124) were the only chosen men who took the responsibility of administrating the trust of the viceregency of Allah and successfully fulfilled it to the fullest satisfaction of the creator of the trust.\nAllama Abd al Husayn Sharaf al Din al Musawi says in Al Muraji-at:\n\"The trust given to mankind is the imamah (leadership) of the Ahl ul Bayt which the Muslims failed to follow because of their iniquity and ignorance.\"\n"

This most important fact of faith has been mentioned many times in the Quran so as to enable every sensible human being to be ever mindful of the true and only benefactor.

For the control over time and distance Sulayman could command see Naml: 38, 39. Regarding the jinn being made to serve under Sulayman see Naml: 17.\nThe jinn must naturally be uncontrollable, rebellious beings because the phrase be-idhni rabbihi indicates that some special control of Allah was needed to make them work submissively. The punishment mentioned to be waiting for the disobedient among them, implies that they were by nature liable to revolt and disobey the authority of man. The first being to disobey Allah in the matter of prostrating before Adam, while all the angels immediately did so, was neither an angel nor a human being, but a genie. It is said that Iblis was a genie, made of fire, and he opposed the very first man while the man was yet in his creation (Araf: 12).\nInspite of such clear statements, the Ahmadi commentator interprets the word jinn as \"the aliens\" quoting 2 Chronicles 2 : 12 to 18-\"Solomon took a census of all the aliens, resident in Israil.\" This interpretation is against the clear evidence of the Quran that jinn are other than human beings, and are made of fire. To console the materialists of the West, the Ahmadi commentator is consistently opposed to belief in any kind of supernatural powers having been granted to any prophet of Allah, and hence he interprets every miracle of the prophets in his own peculiar way. This is an outright denial of the special gifts bestowed by Allah on His prophets.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIn refutation of the materialistic view of life, verse 9 refers to the evidence afforded by the general and natural phenomena, while subsequent verses refer to the particular miracles given to the prophets.\n"

I have fulfilled my promise to him, but his seed has turned ungrateful to My grace and bounties and I shall send a chastisement on them.\" Allah then afflicted them with a plague, which was withdrawn when Dawud invoked Allah to spare them. Allah said: O Dawud, tell my servants to offer their gratitude for the prayer I answered, by building a masjid where your progeny and other future generations may also pray to Me.\" The construction of the masjid was commenced and the righteous Israelites and Dawud himself laboured to build it, carrying heavy stones and mud on their backs. When the walls of the masjid rose to a man's height, Dawud was informed by Allah that his share in the building of the masjid was complete, because the remaining work had been designated to his son Sulayman. Dawud died in the one hundred and fortieth year of his age and Sulayman succeeded his father to the throne in the thirteenth year of his age, and completed the construction of the masjid.\nThe Holy Prophet, like Dawud and Sulayman, laboured to construct the first masjid in Madina, at Quba.\nMaharib are the houses of defence during warfare, fortresses.\nThe concluding words of admonition to the children of Dawud to work, is a general injunction to every nation, and to the Muslims in particular indicating that if a people desire the blessings of Allah on them to be sustained, they must labour in the way of Allah for righteousness. Only a few adhered to the command while the remainder fell into luxury and ease, and suffered the natural consequences of their degradation and a miserable, ignominious life.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nMaharib means huge temples, altars, arches, vast halls.

For details refer to the books of fiqh.\nSome critics attempt to slander the followers of the Ahlul Bayt by saying that they have borrowed their views about the Ahl ul Bayt from the adoration of the family of Dawud by the Jews. In reply, firstly the Quran itself has given the exceptionally distinguished status to the Ahl ul Bayt, excluding all others (see Ali Imran: 61 and Ahzab: 33). Secondly, Nur: 55 expressly says that the method of the caliphate after the Holy Prophet will be the same as before. Thirdly, the Quran asserts that the families of Ibrahim and Imran are chosen by Allah to hold the book, the Wisdom and the authority (Ali Imran: 33 and 34)\n"

I want to view the whole of Allah's kingdom around me from the top of my palace, so let no one disturb me.' He climbed to the top with his staff in his hand, and while he stood viewing the kingdom around him a beautifully dressed young man appeared from a corner of the palace. Sulayman asked him: 'Who are you? Who gave you permission to come here? I had ordered that none should be allowed to enter.' The visitor replied: 'The owner has given me permission.' Sulayman said: 'I am the owner.' The stranger said: 'Allah is the owner of the universe. I am the angel of death and I have been sent to take your soul from your body.' Sulayman said: 'Then go ahead, and fulfill the duty for which the Lord has sent you.' While Sulayman stood leaning on his staff, his soul left his body, but the staff supported the body in that posture a full year. The people below could see him standing and thought him to be alive. When some considerable time had passed many people began to worship him as a god. Some people said that he was a magician, with the power of control over their perception, so as to make them see him standing there. Allah commanded the white ants to chew his staff, then it collapsed, and the body of Sulayman fell on the ground, and at that time the people came to know that he was dead. Until that moment they had believed him to be living and therefore continued to perform the duties entrusted to them by him.\"\nThe event has several factors of guidance for mankind which are given below:\nNo amount of power, however great, possessed by anyone in this world, is permanent, and power and glory, however great, enjoyed by man comes to an end.\nNone, not even the prophets of Allah, are exempted from undergoing the reality of death.\nGreat events like the death of Sulayman could be manifested by unseen agencies as commanded by Allah.\nEven the smallest creatures can destroy strong, hard structures like Sulayman's staff, which had born the weight of his body for a long time.\nA man, who unconditionally submits himself to Allah's will, like Sulayman, could have control over all Allah's creatures in order to fulfill His will. Any body can survive and remain stationary, for any period beyond the ordinary limits of our limited knowledge in accordance with Allah's will. The forces of nature are always subservient to the chosen servants of Allah.\nThings people regard impossible to achieve, Allah effects with ease through His will.\nA true and godly responsibility to control men, materials and matters is given to a chosen individual endowed with divine wisdom, not to ordinary men who are either elected by the people or usurp the authority by force.\nThe knowledge of the unknown is with Allah only and not with men or jinn.\nThe greatest and most magnificent structures designed by men or jinn decay and ultimately perish.\nDeath is decreed by Allah and could not be avoided or delayed.

The town referred to is Ma-rib, near Yemen, amply irrigated by the great dam Sadd Ma-rib, wherein lived the people of Saba or Sheba mentioned in the Bible-I Kings 10, and 2 Chronicles 9.\nThe soil of Saba was very rich and there was an abundant water supply. The whole area flourished with profoundly yielding fruit gardens and was free from venomous serpents and insects. The climate was very pleasant. Each of the twelve townships of Saba had its own prophet of Allah. Each of the prophets called their people to correct belief in Allah, the true Lord of the universe, and to righteous living. They preached: \"Eat of what Allah from His grace and mercy has provided to you, and be thankful and grateful to Him who is the most merciful.\"\nIt was a happy and prosperous country, amply supplied with canals and roads, and skirted by gardens to the right and left, but the people became arrogant of their prosperity, their skills and the achievements of their ancestors. Allah therefore punished them by destroying their habitations, gardens and cultivated fields. A mighty flood came and the dam burst.\nThe French traveller T.J. Arnaud saw the town and ruins of the dam of Ma-arib in 1874, and described its gigantic works and its inscriptions in Journal Asiatique for January 1874. The dam as measured by Arnaud was two miles long and 120 feet high. The date of destruction was somewhere about 120 A.D. The flourishing land was converted into a waste.\n"

In order to make more profit the distance between two towns had to be extended, because a few stations which they could monopolise would bring more money. Their grasping nature put aside the moral standards of righteousness. Monopoly in trade and industry not only spreads poverty among people but also destroys the moral fabric of the society. They fell into the snare of Shaytan, therefore fell from divine grace and declined. They gradually passed out of history, and became only a name in a story. Prosperity is only a snare unless used for the highest service of Allah and His servants, an nas (common people).\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe people of Saba neglected the bounties of Allah and invited the miseries on themselves. This is true of the material, as well as the spiritual life of man. Thus Imam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq quotes this verse to illustrate that the trouble which engulfed the Muslims (and will continue until the reappearance of Imam Al Mahdi al Qa-im) was due to the ingratitude shown by the people concerning Ghadir Khum.

As man's knowledge of the processes of nature advances, he sees how complex is the working of the creation itself. The origin of life and the spiritual forces are yet beyond the ken of experimental sciences, but man has become so conscious of the proximate causes that he has forgotten the primal cause, the cause of causes, the ultimate hand of Allah in creation. For Allah, the creation of anything is only a matter of His will. As He wills anything to originate, it simultaneously exists. See Baqarah: 117, Nahl: 40, Maryam: 35, Ya Sin: 82 and Mumin: 68.\nAngels are spiritual beings through whom the will or the orders or the decrees of Allah are executed or announced. Angels can take any shape or form, except the forms of base animals. The messenger angel Jibrail took the form of a man when he appeared to the virgin Maryam to announce the joyful news that Isa would be born of her (Maryam: 17; Ali Imran: 42 to 47) For the messenger spirit see Shu-ara: 193 and Qadr: 4.\nThe creative process in the universe has never stopped at any time. It is continuously in progress together with the bestowal of Allah's grace and mercy upon His creation.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n(i) The word malak is derived from malaka (to possess), and not from alak (conveying the message). The angel as such is not the message, but the carrier of the message.\n(ii) It refers to the multi-functional aspects of the increase as per Allah's will.

Death may come at any time. See Luqman : 33. Through the seductive temptations of the vanities of this world, man is made to forget the hereafter, and Shaytan may make him spiritually blind, gradually deluding him until his thoughts and life style become evil.

It is to be noted that the honour of being chosen by Allah applies to the whole group, that is, to all the holy Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt to whom the Quran was entrusted This inference is in complete harmony with the well-known declaration of the Holy Prophet commonly known as hadith al thaqalayn (see page 6).\nAccording to the interpretation of Imam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir and Imam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq the reference in this verse is to the progeny of Ali and Fatimah, which is the progeny of the Holy Prophet.\n(i) There are those who do not recognise Allah's chosen Imam of the age.

They replied that they were the messengers from Isa, the prophet of Allah, and had been sent to invite people to the religion of Allah. The shepherd wished to see if they had any signs to prove their bonafide. They said that they could cure the sick and restore sight to the born blind and cure the born lepers. On this, the shepherd took those men to his son who was sick for long and no one could help him. They prayed to Allah and the sick son of the shepherd was cured. The shepherd embraced the religion of Allah preached by Isa.\nHearing about the arrival of these men in the city, the man known as \"mumin of ali Yasin\", who believed in the advent of the Holy Prophet, even 680 years before his coming, came out from his retreat and embraced the true faith, and a great number of sick in the city were cured by the disciples of Isa.\nThe King, who was a stubborn non-believer, imprisoned those messengers of Isa. On hearing the fate of his messengers, Isa sent another of his disciple Simon who came to the city and pretended to belong to the King's faith (an example of taqiyyah) and gained influence over him. See Acts 11: 16.\nThus, the despatch of two messengers was more strengthened by the third from Isa.

In these verses it has been used as an adjuration to witness the truth of a solemn affirmation and to emphasise that affirmation. It is a solemn appeal to a person or persons to believe in the important statements, made in these verses, on the basis of sublime and out of the ordinary evidence. Wa has been used here to assert, with special emphasis, the truth of that which is presented in order to render null and void expected rejection, if any.\nAre the doers of the three things noted in these verses the same persons, or are they three distinct sets of persons? In either case, who are they? Many commentators take them to refer to angels and good men, the men of God, who strive and range themselves in Allah's service, defend truth and destroy the power base of evil, whenever necessary, and proclaim the truth of the word of Allah. Some commentators add \"Lord of\" in every verse, in which case wa becomes an oath, an invocation in the name of Allah, to assert the truth.\nIn sinlessness and infallibility, according to the Quran, the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, in addition to other prophets of Allah, are the only men of God. As per verses 33 of Al Ahzab and 61 of Ali Imran, they are the only \"human beings\" thoroughly purified. They are not only as pure and holy as the angels are but also stand high and above the angels in rank and honour, according to the commentary of Baqarah: 30 to 39. By becoming aware of the existence of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt Adam was declared superior to the angels who, when commanded by Allah, fell prostrate before him. So no other human being can be joined with the holy and pure angels in these verses as men of God except the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, because as said in Fatir: 19 to 22:-\n\"Alike are not the blind and those who can see, nor darkness and light, nor shade and heat, nor the living and the dead.\"\nSo the pure and the impure cannot be joined by the just and wise Lord together.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 37:6]\nSama-ad dunya means the lowest heaven, nearest to the earth. It is said to be the seat of the exalted assembly of angels, as pointed out in verse 8. The beauty of the starry heaven is proverbial. Their marvellous beauty, their coherent grouping and harmonious working manifest the unity. control and wisdom of the one true creator.\nThe perfect, harmonious, undisturbed and continuous existence of creation in the heavens, under the precise laws made by Allah, cannot be disturbed or upset by any rebellious evil, so it is cast away on every side, repulsed, under a perpetual penalty, by a flaming fire.\nGoodness is always protected by the all good against evil.\nThe men of God, mentioned in the commentary of verses 1 to 3 of this surah, are goodness personified or the true reflection or manifestation of the absolute goodness of the Lord, therefore every type of evil has been kept off from them. They have been thoroughly purified as per verse 33 of Ahzab. Also refer to Hijr: 40 and 42 and Bani Israil: 65 to know that Shaytan has no authority over the men of God mentioned above. Goodness is real and eternal. Evil is the consequence of the rebellious urge of the devil. It shall die its own death when the devil, along with his followers, goes to hell. So far as it lives in this world it cannot rise to the higher region of goodness, even if it tries to have a glimpse of the world of total righteousness. Its area of operation is the abyss.\nNo evil spirit can ever penetrate even the lowest heaven. Refer to the commentary of Hijr: 16 to 18.\nAfter the advent of the Holy Prophet the doors of even the lowest regions were closed to the devils and evil spirits.\nPrior to the advent of the Holy Prophet, the jinn and devils had access to the outskirts of heaven, and by assiduous eavesdropping secured some of the secrets of the upper world, which they communicated to soothsayers upon the earth. After the advent of the Holy Prophet they were driven from the heavens, and whenever they dared to approach, flaming bolts were hurled at them, appearing to mankind like falling stars.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThose who are immersed in the worldly pleasures are unable to have any communion with the exalted beings of the higher sphere, even if they try to steal a glimpse of that which is there.\n"

They threw him into a blazing furnace, but by the will of Allah the fire did not harm him (see commentary of Anbiya: 51 to 73).\nWhen Ibrahim found the people immune to every kind of admonition and guidance, he entrusted himself to Allah and left the place. This was Ibrahim's hijrat. He migrated to Syria. Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 207 and Anfal: 30. The Holy Prophet also left his place of birth to settle in Madina under Allah's command. During this journey to Syria his good hearted wife Sara who could not till then bear any child for him, gave her slave girl Hajira as a gift to Ibrahim who prayed to Allah for a child at least from the newly acquired wife, to have an inheritor from his own family as did Musa, Zakariya and the Holy Prophet. The boy thus born was Ismail, the first born son of Ibrahim (see commentary of Baqarah: 124 to 129).\nHalim means \"ready to suffer and forbear.\" The quality of forbearance has been mentioned specially to distinguish Ibrahim and his son Ismail, the ancestors of the Holy Prophet.\nAccording to Imam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq, Prophet Ishaq was born to Sara after five years of the birth of Ismail to Hajira.\nAlthough Sara had herself presented Hajira to her husband, but after her giving birth to Ismail, she could not tolerate Hajira with her son Ismail remaining in the same place.\nUnder these circumstances, Ibrahim had to bring Hajira and his son Ismail to Makka and left them there entrusting the mother and child to Allah (see commentary of Baqarah: 124 to 129).\nWhen Ibrahim revisited Hajira, his son Ismail was thirteen years old.\nIbrahim saw in a dream that he was sacrificing Ismail. It was on the 8th of Dhilhajj, known as yawm al tariwiyah. Next day he saw the same dream again, known as arafat; and was convinced that it is a command of Allah and decided to act as he was asked by the Lord. Ibrahim told Hajira to prepare Ismail for a journey to a friend's place and provide him with a rope and a knife.\nWhen he reached the place Sa-i, between two hillocks, Safa and Marwa, Ibrahim disclosed his dream to Ismail who bid his father to go ahead and offer the sacrifice.\nShaytan appeared in the guise of an old man and tried to prevent Ibrahim from offering the sacrifice. Having failed to convince Ibrahim he turned to Ismail and persuaded him to run away and save his life. Both the prophets of Allah saw through his scheme and as a sign of repulsing his accursed intrigue Ibrahim threw seven small stones at him.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nSleep is a state of partial consciousness for the prophets of Allah, so their dreams come true and are fulfilled. What Ibrahim, as a prophet of Allah, saw in his dream was as valid as an experience in wakefulness.\nIbrahim told Ismail what he saw in the dream as an indication, and Ismail accepted it as an imperative.\nWhat Imam Husayn bin Ali saw in his dream in Madina was also an imperative. The Holy Prophet asked him: \"Go to Iraq and give your life in the cause of Allah, because Allah has so willed.\"\nIn the case of Ismail the sacrifice was stopped but the sacrifice Husayn offered was accepted by Allah as dhibhin azim according to verse 107.\nMuhammad Iqbal, the poet of the east, has said;\n\"Ismail was the beginning, Husayn was the ultimate.\"\nBefore laying his son on the ground to fulfil what he had been commanded in his dream to do, on the request of Ismail, Ibrahim tied his hands and legs, and blindfolded himself and wrapped his cloak, so that at the time of slaughter if Ismail felt pain and became restless, Ibrahim might not be disturbed; and as a father, Ibrahim would not be able to witness his son's slaughter if he remained blindfolded; and the cloak was rolled up in order to spare Hajirah from seeing the blood of Ismail on Ibrahim's clothes. Then, as commanded, Ibrahim took the knife and enacted exactly what he had seen in his dream and thus carried out the command of his Lord. But, when he removed the fold from his eyes, to his surprise, he found Ismail standing safe by his side and in his place, a ram lay slain before them.\n"

An ordinary ram by no means, in any sense whatsoever, can be termed as great; moreover under no circumstances a ram can be greater than Ismail son of Ibrahim, both the most distinguished prophets of Allah, in whose progeny Allah had appointed His divinely commissioned Imams (see commentary of Baqarah : 124). The ransom, therefore, is essentially a great sacrifice Allah had kept in store for future when the religion of Allah would be perfected and completed after the advent of the Holy Prophet.\nIt was indeed a great and momentous occasion when two men of God stood ready to offer to Allah that which was dearest to them to seek His pleasure, then Allah puts off this great manifestation of \"devotion and surrender to His will\" which was the real purpose of the trial (not blood and flesh) to a future date, so that the \"devotion and surrender to Allah's will\" should be demonstrated in a greater style and degree than what Ibrahim and Ismail could. This type of service Imam Husayn performed, many ages later, in 60 A.H., and as he was a descendant of Ibrahim and Ismail the credit of \"the great sacrifice\" goes to them also. For the great sacrifice of Imam Husayn read the biography of Imam Husayn published by our Trust, a close study of which makes clear that his sacrifice has been rightly mentioned as dhibhin azim in this verse.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nShah Wali-ullah, in Sirrush Shahadaytan, and many other well known authors of traditions and history have accepted the fact that dhibhin azim refers to the sacrifice of Imam Husayn.

According to it he lived in the reign of Ahab (896-874 B.C.) and Ahaziah (874-872 B.C.), kings of the northern kingdom of Israil or Samaria. After Musa, the people began to worship Baal, the sun-god worshipped in Syria. Ilyas denounced all sins of Ahab and Ahaziah and warned people to stop the worship of Baal and believe in the true religion of Musa.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"We perpetuated\" has been mentioned in verse 108 after the mention of Ibrahim and Ismail who have been described as shi-ahs of Nuh in verse 83, and then in verse 119 it is again mentioned for Musa and Harun, and finally in verse 129 after the mention of Ilyas. According to ziyarat waritha the Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet represent all the earlier prophets as stated in the above noted verses that Allah perpetuated their glory and praise in generations to come in later times.\nAs mentioned in history Ilyas or Ilyah or Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind to heaven when the people planned to kill him. He is still alive; and is represented by Ali ibn abi Talib.\nIn connection with the verses praising the Ahl ul Bayt, Ibn Hajar has written verse 130 as the third verse in the eleventh chapter of his book Sawa-iq al Muhriqah and has stated therein on the authority of Ibn Abbas that \"ali yasin\" (or il yasin) means ali Muhammad. He writes that Kalbi also holds the same view. Fakhr al Din al Razi writes that the Ahl ul Bayt are at par with the Holy Prophet in five things:\n(i) In salutation, for Allah said: \"Peace be to you, O prophet.\" and He also said: \"Peace be to the ali yasin.\"\n(ii) In invoking the blessings of Allah during prayers, after each tashhahud.\n(iii) In their purity, for Allah revealed the verses of purification (Ahzab: 33) for the Ahl ul Bayt.\n(iv) In the sadqah (alms) being forbidden for them.\n(v) In love, for Allah said: \"Say: I ask you no recompense except that you love my kindred.\" (Shura: 23)\n"

A great fish swallowed up Yunus. He was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

I am indeed of the unjust.\" (Anbiya: 87).\nIf the above noted portion of Anbiya: 87 is recited 12 times for 40 days after any one of the 5 obligatory prayers regularly, the reciter receives help from Allah to put an end to the sorrow or misfortune he or she is afflicted with.\nBy the command of Allah the fish vomited out him upon the dry land. He was in a state of sickness. Allah caused to grow gourd plant there whose large leaves he used to protect his body from the hot sun, flies and other insects which were preying on his wounded body.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 38:4]\nThe pagans of Makka referred to the Holy Prophet as a sorcerer, dreamer, poet and an impostor (see commentary of Anbiya: 3 and 5), because he invited them to the worship of Allah, made all their false gods disappear, brought harmony in place of chaos, and peace in place of discord and conflict. They tried their best to persuade Abu Talib to denounce and renounce his nephew, but failed. After the \"feast of the near relatives\" (see commentary of Ali Imran: 52 and 53) the tribal chiefs declared that the Holy Prophet wanted to destroy their power and influence in order to take authority in his own hands.\nThey thought that the most powerful weapon the Holy Prophet had was the message of tawhid (unity of Allah) with which he was demolishing the syndrome of false gods and upsetting the status quo of the pagan society which their forefathers had established.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThey opposed the preaching of the divine mission tooth and nail because the society based on idol worship gave them influence, privileges and power to exploit the people as they liked. Even when they embraced Islam, they could not, on account of this tendency, accept as true the divine declaration so they demanded share in the authority and finally usurped it by turning their back on the covenant they made with Allah and His Prophet on the day of Ghadir Khum (see commentary of Ma-idah: 67).\nMillatil akhirah refers to the last religion preached before Islam, which had itself departed from monotheism to trinity, so the pagans did not find any trace of tawhid in it, and concluded that the message the Holy Prophet brought was a made-up tale.\nThen envy surfaced in them. They said: \"If a message had to come, why should it come to the orphan son of Abdullah, and not to one of our own chiefs?\"\nIn reply it is said that people have no idea as to how Allah executes His will. The agency or the medium of the divine guidance like risalat or imamat does not need any worldly pomp and show of wealth or possessions. It needs men of ideal purity, special excellence, knowledge, wisdom, forbearance, insight, strength, courage, personal character, spirit of sacrifice and total surrender to the will of Allah. Such men are conditioned and chosen by Allah Himself for the purpose. See commentary of Ahzab: 33, Ali Imran: 61 and Baqarah: 124.\nThe drift and deviation so clearly visible in the collective life of the ummah of the last prophet of Allah, after his departure from this world, was mainly due to not following the clear commands of Allah and the Holy Prophet concerning the authority of the Ahl ul Bayt to guide mankind and administer the human society. They fell an easy prey to the doctrine of ghlu wa ghalba (force and prevalence). Those finding themselves in a favourable position succeeded in assuming the rein of authority and the rest of ummah timidly accepted the authority of every such usurper who, after taking power by hook or crook eventually established himself as the vicegerent of the Holy Prophet, though he flouted the laws of Islam with impunity-like Mu-awiyah bin Abu Sufyan, Yazid bin Mu-awiyah, Walid bin Abdul Malik, Walid bin Yazid, Abu Jafar Mansur, Harun ar Rashid etcetera-and almost all the caliphs of Bani Umayyah and Banu Abbas fall in this category. There was an army of clever theoreticians and opportunist religious scholars to support them in their ungodly and unislamic activities. The true inheritors of the Holy Prophet, the Ahl ul Bayt, the custodians of the laws of Allah, were ignored, persecuted and killed. A few who remained attached with them were mercilessly punished. Yet the Islam-original, known as Shi-aism, weathered all storms with the help of the sincere and devoted followers of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe pagans, not only belied the medium through whom the divine guidance was conveyed, but also refused to believe in the revelation itself.\n"

Then Dawud sent his own proposal and her guardians, impressed by Dawud's position as king, gave her hand to him in marriage. Dawud already had 99 wives. She became his hundredth wife.\nUriya was disappointed. He thought that Dawud should have used his influence to convince the girl's guardians in his favour. What Dawud did was not a sin, but in the opinion of Uriya, Dawud, as a brother and also as the king, could have given preference to him.\nAllah sent two angels in human form to Dawud. They were not allowed to enter his private chamber where he used to retire for his devotional prayers. They climbed over a wall, entered his private chamber and said that they had come to seek redress at his hands.\nOne of them said: \"This my brother has a flock of 99 sheep, and I had but one; yet he wants me to give up my one sheep to his keeping. He talks like one intending mischief.\" Without giving a chance to the other who also came to him as a contender Dawud decreed his demand unjust. The two angels disappeared as mysteriously as they had come. It was then realised by Dawud that it was a trial. In self-complacence he passed the judgement before listening to the defendant. As soon as it became evident to him, he turned to Allah in repentance.\nAccording to Imam Ali who so casts aspersion on Dawud on account of his marrying the girl betrothed to his brother must be condemned because every prophet of Allah is free from emotional weaknesses and sinful desires; particularly if the accuser is a Muslim the doubt amounts to blasphemy.\nThe Biblical passages about Dawud are mere chroniques scandaleuses-narrative of scandalous crimes of the grossest character. The Quranic idea of Dawud is that of a just and upright prophet, endowed with all the virtues, in whom even the least thought of self-elation has to be washed off by repentance.\n"

Then he lost his home, his possessions, his family; and suffered from sores, but he did not lose faith, he turned to Allah. Those lacking faith suspected that Ayyub had committed some sin and was being punished, but those good at heart, said that he, as a prophet of Allah, was being tested to manifest ideal patience.\nShaytan, during his sufferings, tried to make him lose confidence in the mercy of Allah. Ayyub, in his prayer to Allah, referred to Shaytan's endeavor to disturb his faith in Him and to the belief of vain people about his having committed some sin which had drawn His anger.\nWhen Shaytan failed in his every effort to strip Ayyub of his title of \"the patient\" he beguiled Ayyub's wife to lead him astray. He went to her as an experienced physician and convinced her that if she could take the sheep he had with him and sacrifice it in his name, he would immediately be cured. Since the wife was interested in Ayyub's welfare, she came to him and related the suggestion of the physician.\nAyyub warned his wife not to be misled by the man because he was none but Shaytan.\nShaytan came back again as a beautiful young man astride a thorough bred stallion and told her: \"I\nam the king of the earth, and since your husband worshipped Allah, the king of the heavens, not me, it was I who caused the loss of your children and wealth. If, now, you prostrate before me once, l shall make your husband well again.\"\nShe promised to do as he wanted if her husband allowed her to do so. Then Shaytan asked her to at least persuade Ayyub not to say bismillah before eating a meal and alhamdulillah after finishing it. Hardly had she mentioned the proposal, Ayyub was so much disturbed at the very audacity of it that he swore forewith to punish her with hundred stripes. Then he prayed to Allah: \"Indeed an affliction has distressed me.\"\nThere is another version that once when there was no food in the house she went to get at least a loaf of bread for Ayyub. A man attracted by her lovely hair agreed to give her food in exchange of a bunch of her hair. She gave it to him and brought some food. In those days hair of a woman was cut and removed if she was found guilty of fornication. It greatly pained Ayyub to see her head without her beautiful hair. He then swore to punish her with hundred stripes.\nThe prophet of Allah Ayyub used to pray for those who came to him with incurable diseases and ailments. But when they asked him why he did not pray for himself, he said: \"I have enjoyed Allah's grace and blessing for 80 years, and it would be downright ingratitude if now I grumble when I have been made to taste distress for some time.\"\nIn his seven years illness he never uttered a single word of remonstration or grief, but due to the persistent pestering of Shaytan, he used to invite Allah's attention and help for combating his evil designs.\nThe highest example of patience and fortitude to demonstrate total submission to the will of Allah was set forth by the grandsons of the Holy Prophet, Imam Husayn bin Ali in Karbala and Imam Ali bin Husayn Zayn al Abidin in Kufa and Damascus. They were the true inheritors of the Holy Prophet in whom all the virtues of all the prophets of Allah had been deposited by Allah in the highest degree.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n\"Shaytan has afflicted me with distress\" refers to the hardships Ayyub had to face and overcome with the help of Allah in the cause of righteousness. The arch opponent of righteousness is Shaytan who represents rebellion, evil and disorder.\n"

Again it has been described as a message of great importance in verse 67 of this surah, from which man turns away as said in verse 68; and verse 69 again refers to verse 30 of al Baqarah. For the vice-regency (imamah) Allah selects and appoints His own chosen representatives on the earth. The selection is not arbitrary. Only those whose submission to His will is absolute and unconditional due to which they remain in constant communion with Allah are chosen. See commentary of al Baqarah: 124. The doctrine of imamah has been represented in the Quran in various ways. Even the angels were not clear about this great message. They first disputed, then submitted to the will of Allah, but Shaytan rebelled and was condemned and cursed for ever for not accepting the imamah of the chosen representatives of Allah.\nThis condition of acceptance and rejection continued in the children of Adam in various forms and manners.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 40:55]\nRefer to Nisa: 106.\nBy isolating wastaghfir lidhambika from its context the preconceived antagonism of the Christian commentators led them to believe that the Holy Prophet was not free from sinning; so a sinner cannot purify other sinners.\nThe word ghafar means to cover or protect, so istighfar means seeking protection. Zanb means an act of inadvertence or an unintentional shortcoming which is quite different from ithm (peculiarly intentional sin).\nWastaghfir lidhambika actually means \"seek protection (of your Lord) against (any natural or unintentional) shortcoming\". Protection is sought before any untoward or undesireable event takes place, not after a calamity afflicts. When a sin is committed forgiveness and pardon is sought, not protection.\nThe Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt were thoroughly purified by Allah (Ahzab: 33). In Maryam: 51 Allah says that Musa was freed from all impurities. The status of the Holy Prophet is much higher than Musa and all other prophets. See commentary of Ali Imran: 81; Baqarah: 253, 285 and Bani Israil: 1. According to Hijr: 39; Araf : 16 and 17 and Ibrahim: 22, it is Shaytan who allures man unto sin, and Nahl: 99 and Hijr: 40 say that he has no authority over the purified servants of Allah. So all the prophets of Allah are infallible. They always sought the protection of their Lord against the efforts of Shaytan. As verse 27 of Anbiya says: \"They speak not before He speaks; and they always act by His command.\"\nEvery prophet of Allah had a natural inclination to seek goodness from Allah for his followers. He felt that their welfare was his responsibility. He treated their happiness or salvation as his own. So he always sought pardon and forgiveness for his people as he would do for his own self, and therefore he was addressed in person at many places in the Quran instead of his followers; and commandments intended for the people were addressed to the prophet. For example in Araf: 150 and 151, although the people had worshipped the calf, Musa prays to seek protection for himself and his brother Harun, using the same words: Rabbigh-firli wa li-akhi (O Lord grant protection to me and my brother).\nIn Baqarah: 286, man has been taught to pray: \"wa-fu anna waghfirlana warhamna (our Lord, pardon us, and grant us protection, and have mercy on us).\" For pardon afu, and for protection against sinning in future ighfir have been used. In verse 25 of Bani Israil ghafar (protection) is promised for those who do deeds of righteousness, not for those who do evil, so protection becomes reward. In verse 7 of this surah the angels who bear the arsh seek protection (yastaghfiruna) for the believers, otherwise to seek pardon for those who believe in Allah, do good and follow His religion becomes meaningless. In verse 8 of Tahrim first the believers will be purified and freed from all traces of evil, then they will be admitted into the paradise where they shall pray: \"O Lord, perfect for us our light and grant us protection.\" If instead of protection, pardon is used, then it carries no meaning.\nBaqarah: 129, 151 ; Ali Imran: 164; Bara-at: 103 and Jumu-ah: 2 clearly make known that it is the Holy Prophet who was sent by Allah with a prerogative to purify mankind.\nThe Quran proclaims the infallibility of Isa, but Jesus of the Bible is presented as a timid, frightened and despondent individual.\n\"Jesus cried aloud: \"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\" which means, 'My God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?' \" (Matthew 27 : 46).\n\"He went on a little, fell on his face in prayer, and said, 'My father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Yet not as I will, but as Thou wills.'\" (Matthew 26: 39)\nWhen the God of Christian church has forsaken His own begotten son without any reason, for no fault has been ascribed to him in the Bible, then He will definitely forsake the common sinners. A forsaken son of God will never be able to save the sinners from divine punishment; and when he himself did not surrender to the will of God, he could not ask others to submit to the will of God.\nThe true interpretation of this verse is seeking protection of Allah against any possible act of inadvertence in future for his faithful followers, not for himself.\nAs stated in Ali Imran: 41, evening and morning are the best time for celebrating the praises and glory of Allah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAll finite beings have the inherent shortcoming of not owning anything of their own. A dark object receives light from an illuminating source, but the light it receives never becomes its property. It is there so far the source is directed towards it; and as soon as its direction is changed the inherent darkness reappears. Whatever excellence a created being owns is a gift from Allah. No finite being has an existence of its own. Any degree of existence it has is a gift bestowed on it by the eternal source of existence and the moment it is withdrawn the existence of the finite being ceases to be. Among the finite beings, man is distinguished from other finite beings by the ability to receive more and more gifts of excellences from the infinite providence to cover inherent shortcomings. To obtain it he has to pray for it. This prayer is called istighfar (to seek a cover). There is no one among the finite beings who is exempt from istighfar. To receive more and more, continuous istighfar is necessary. Ordinary men are often unmindful of their shortcomings. The men of God are constantly alive to the danger of falling into the trap of shortcomings, so they make use of continuous istighfar. It is a virtue which all prophets of Allah proudly owned. It is also a way of life of the prophets to set an example to their followers. The Holy Prophet as the foremost guide in the order of devotion, submission and worship seeks protection against any remotest possibility of even an unintentional act of inadvertence and includes his faithful followers in his prayer. He is witness over witnesses. Refer to Bani Israil: 1 for the prayer of all the prophets behind the Holy Prophet. On the day of judgement every person will be worried for his own salvation but the Holy Prophet will represent the whole mankind for their salvation before Allah.\nTherefore his istighfar is not only for himself but for all the believers. See Muhammad: 19 and Fath : 2.\nZanb, in connection with the Holy Prophet or any other prophet, does not mean sin.\n"

In all du-as request is made to Allah alone, but through the wasilah (means of approach)-the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt.\nDu-as taught by the Holy Prophet and his holy Ahl ul Bayt, particularly Imam Ali ibn abi Talib and Imam Ali bin Husayn Zayn al Abidin, are twice blessed. Firstly they provide for us the most suitable words and proper form to approach and beseech the merciful Allah. Secondly, if the meanings are understood they leave a profound impression of the oneness of Allah and His attributes on our minds and souls, and as a result our character formation takes after and follows the pattern laid down by the religion of Allah, Islam.\nThese Dua-as are also a proof of our pure faith in the \"One and Only\" Allah.\nThey make clear relationship between man and God, and reciprocal relations between human beings, and build up a collective discipline which can be used to set up the much desired ideal society based upon love, peace, harmony, fair play, justice and freedom-the good free from evil.\nFaithful servants of Allah turn repentant to Allah, seek His forgiveness, take refuge with Him, look for His mercy, ask for His blessings, and put forward their legitimate needs and wants for fulfilment.\nWholehearted devotion to the \"Lord of the worlds\" bring favourable results, purifies the soul, gives joy and confidence to the heart and sense of direction to the mind, cultivates refinement, builds up high-mindedness, self-control, understanding and mental equilibrium.\nMan is free to make lawful efforts, day in and day out, in the sphere of worldly affairs, but should set apart whatever time may be spared, to turn to the creator, the most merciful and oft-forgiving Allah, never forgetting that unto Allah is the return.\nFor the du-as composed by Imam Ali, Imam Zayn al Abidin, and by other Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt refer to the prayer's Almanac, Duas Volume 1, 2, 3, and 4, published by our Trust-an English version of Mafatih al Jinan.\nChoose and pray that which is feasible.\nThe minimum shall benefit beyond expectations.\nWhat the maximum has in store is beyond imagination.\n"

As explained in the commentary of Hajj: 47, Sajdah: 5, Ibrahim: 5 the term yawm (day) used in various places in the Quran is not the day of the earth, measured according to the movement of the earth in relation to the sun. When there was no sun or suns in the universe yawm (day) may refer to any period of time known to Allah alone. Here it may mean stages or periods. So the two days may mean two stages, physical and spiritual.\nThe four days mentioned in verse 10 refer to the several stages in which the creation of the heavens and the earth took place, and the sequence of the order in which the various components of the universe were brought into existence. Refer to Baqarah: 29; Rad: 3; Nahl: 15 and Saffat: 6.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nVerse 11 may refer to the theory of nebula.

Utbah bin Rabi-a was selected. He came to the Holy Prophet and said: \"Are you better than your ancestors? Abdullah, Abdul Muttalib and Hashim did not condemn our gods. If you are aspiring for power we will make you our supreme chief, put our most beautiful women at your disposal, and amass mountains of gold and silver in your courtyard.\" The Holy Prophet, in reply, recited the first 18 verses of this surah. When the fate of the people of Ad and Thamud was mentioned, Utbah requested the Holy Prophet to stop. He stood up and left his presence. He went directly to his home. The Quraysh chiefs thought that Utbah had also fallen under the spell of the son of Abdullah. They went to him and began to cast aspersion on his integrity. In plain words he told them: \"What Muhammad told me was neither poetry nor soothsaying. He simply recited something from the Quran. I am afraid that if we oppose him a painful torment may also seize us.\"\n"

The same opinion is found in Tafsir Kashaf, Sahih Muslim, Musnad ibn Hanbal and Tafsir Durr al Manthur.\nThis verse commands the Muslims to love the Ahl ul Bayt if they want to repay the Holy Prophet for his toils of prophethood, so that they should follow the Ahl ul Bayt in word and deed, because they have been thoroughly purified by Allah Himself, because they are the truthful, because they are the custodians of the word of Allah, because they alone know the true interpretation of the guidance sent for all mankind.\nA large number of narratives reported by the most reliable authorities of the Islamic history prove that this verse was revealed in Madina after the births of Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn. Even if they were not born and this verse was revealed in Makka, no Muslim can deny that Allah has the absolute authority to refer to future events and persons not yet born, as He refers to the details of the day of judgement or relates the outcome of the battles the Holy Prophet fought in defence.\nThose who try to sidetrack the command of Allah to love the near relatives of the Holy Prophet on flimsy ground must remember that even the least ill-will against the thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt has been forbidden. From the beginning to the end of their lives, every member of the Ahl ul Bayt had presented an ideal Islamic pattern of life, not equalled by any among the followers of the Holy Prophet, therefore love and devotion to them was ordained to provide highest form of guidance to mankind. See commentary of Saba: 47. Unless one loves and follows the Ahl ul Bayt one cannot sincerely avail of the guidance offered by the Holy Prophet. Love implies sincere attachment which must manifest in every thought and deed.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq said:\n\"He who obeys Allah's commands is our devotee; and he who disobeys His commands is our enemy.\"\nAfter the departure of the Holy Prophet from this world, his followers:\n(i) deprived her daughter, Bibi Fatimah, of her rights. See commentary of Bani Israil: 26; Naml: 15 and 16; Nahl: 90 and Maryam: 2 to 15;\n(ii) her house was set on fire; a door fell upon her, killing her unborn child, Muhsin, in the womb, due to which, at last, she died,\n(iii) Ali was dragged in the streets of Madina, bound with ropes;\n(iv) Hasan was poisoned;\n(v) Husayn, along with his relatives and friends, was killed in Karbala;\n(vi) the remaining Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt were killed, one by one;\n(vii) and their devotees, who loved and followed them as commanded by Allah, were persecuted and killed.\nIt is reported that the people of Madina, known as ansar, who gave asylum to the people of Makka, known as muhajirin, began to take pride in the role they played in the promotion of the mission of the Holy Prophet. Ibn Abbas and some other immigrants felt unhappy and complained to the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet, then, reminded the ansar that it was because of him they were saved from the accursed dirt of polytheism, and it was he who showed them the right path of salvation. The ansar realised their folly, avowed to put whatever they had at his disposal and follow every command given to them. Then this verse was revealed.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nQurba means nearness. Fil qurba means for the sake of nearness.\nThe unanimous traditions of utmost authenticity assert that nearness to the Holy Prophet means love of his those relatives who are nearest to him in excellence and accomplishment. So, when he was asked to point out his relatives, he pronounced the names of Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn and their children. There is not a single tradition of the Holy Prophet that qurba refers to the relatives of the Quraysh, or the relationship of the Holy Prophet with the Quraysh or the relatives of the believers, as concocted by the anti Ahl ul Bayt commentators. The structure of the verse proves that the Holy Prophet has been commanded to demand recompense, as an exception, not from every one, but from those believers mentioned in Furqan: 57-those who take the way to their Lord. The recompense is in the interest of the believers themselves, not in any way profitable to the Holy Prophet in his personal life.\nInstead of arham (the blood relatives), qurba (neamess) has been used to show that not only relationship but also nearness in character and accomplishment is taken into consideration as the important quality. So, on the basis of this verse, love of the Ahl ul Bayt has become an obligatory function of the faith, a fundamental condition without which no amount of devotion to Allah and good deeds will be of any use.\n"

He does not want to punish the offenders if they turn repentant to Him and live in the light of His guidance thereafter. In verse 53 of Zamur the Holy Prophet says: \"Do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Verily Allah forgives all sins.\"\nCompared to what Islam offers to the sinners (repentance and their living an ordered life free from evil) the doctrine of unconditional redemption, just because a man, unjustly taken as the son of God, has given his blood, is incredible, because it gives unruly licence to sin which certainly spreads corruption, chaos and injustice.\nJabir bin Abdullah Ansari relates an incident in which it is said that a man came into the masjid, prayed a two rak-at salat, and then said: \"O Lord, I seek Your pardon.\" Imam Ali, who was there, said: \"Your repentance is unacceptable. Tawbah (turning repentant unto ADah) should come together with a sincere determination to avoid sinning in the future.\" If any duty has been neglected it should be at once carried out.

The ulil amr may consult people to win their good will, otherwise he has to follow the laws made by Allah to make his final decision.\nAfter the departure of the Holy Prophet, while his true duly appointed successor, Ali ibn abi Talib (see commentary of Ma-idah: 67) was busy with the arrangements for his burial, the muhajirin of Makka and the ansar of Madina assembled at Saqifa Bani Sa-da to prove their respective merits. The muhajirin claimed preference in view of their priority in Islam and their kinship with the Holy Prophet. The ansar referred to their help and support to establish his mission. No one mentioned the historic fact that a few month ago the Holy Prophet had irrevocably nominated Ali as his divinely elected successor. Refer to \"The Early History of Islam\" by Sayyid Safdar Husayn, published by our Trust, for full details of the drama enacted at Saqifa Bani Sa-da. It is said that Abu Bakr was elected as the caliph by consultation and consensus among the companions.\nTherefore many commentators interpret this verse to justify the farce staged to belie and reject the clear command of Allah conveyed by the Holy Prophet at Ghadir Khum.\n"

By means of the second belief, the Ash-aris seek to justify all the evil deeds of such tyrants as Yazid and others whom they regard as khalifatul rasul; hence they insist on predestination which creates the possibility of Allah being unjust.\nImam Ali said:\n\"People wrongly imagine that destiny is abiding and fate is certain. If it were so the idea of reward and penalty becomes meaningless, promise and threat a hoax. Allah, the most praised, has given man freedom of thought and action.\"\nThe freedom of action is conditioned by the laws made by Allah to govern the universe.

He prayed and the relief came.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Dukhan refers to the smoke which will be seen on the day of judgement.\"\nThis is a warning to those who reject the true faith. They will see smoke every where on the day of reckoning. It will envelop them as a grievous penalty.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe penalty referred here will be inflicted upon the disbelievers before the actual reckoning. As this affliction will afflict the whole humanity, only that prophet who was sent to all mankind as a warner and a bearer of glad tidings and a mercy unto the worlds will alone be able to pray to Allah to remove it.\nThe Quraysh had before them a messenger whose purity of life was known to them. They themselves called him al-amin (the trustworthy) and al sadiq (the truthful), yet they turned away from him and called him mad when he invited them to the worship of one God (Allah). Refer to Hijr: 6; Nahl: 103; Araf: 184.\nThough Allah gives respite to the disbelievers to see if that will bring them to the right path, but at last the final judgement will seize the irreclaimable from which there will be no escape.\n"

First they were Sabians then professed the Jewish and the Christian religion. Among the embassies sent by the Holy Prophet in 9-10 Hijra was one to the Himyar of Yemen, which led to their coming into Islam.\nIt is mentioned in Minhaj ul Sadiqin that about 1000 years before the advent of the Holy Prophet, Asad bin Malka abu Ayub, the then Himyarite king, after conquering many lands invaded Madina to take revenge of his slain son. He was a noble and God-fearing man. He used to begin all his letters with \"in the name of Allah, the Lord of the land, the seas, the sun and the wind.\" To prevent him from destroying the city of Madina two men from the tribe of Bani Qurayza went to him and said: \"Do not destroy this city because the last prophet of Allah, one day, will come here to preach the divine religion.\" He not only spared the town but also wrote a letter of felicitation and welcome to the Holy Prophet and handed it over to a Jew named Shamul with instructions to deliver it to him if he comes in his times, or let it be given to him by whosoever be his heir in the times of the Holy Prophet. Abu Ayub Ansari, the 21st offspring in the progeny of Shamul, gave this letter to the Holy Prophet who said: \"Thank you O righteous Tubba.\"\n"

The book of creation presents unity in diversity, and proves the infinite wisdom, omnipotence and justice of the creator Lord of the worlds.\nThough He has power over all things, He does not make arbitrary changes in the laws made by Him to regulate the discipline of the working of the universe, because He is just. By discovering the laws operating the universe, man today is conditioning his activities to achieve success. To a great extent he is moving in the right direction because he follows and obeys the laws made by Allah. It is a clear guidance to him that when strict adherence to the physical laws brings him success, he should also follow and obey the laws made by Him to regulate and discipline his social behaviour so that a fair, just and harmonious order may be instituted to establish an ideal human society which is the real purpose of Islam so far as the life of this world is concerned. He who does this will be His real representative. As said in the commentary of Bara-at: 32 and 33 it will be achieved by the inheritor of the Holy Prophet, Imam Muhammad bin Hasan al Qa-im.\nVerses 6 to 10 refer to the dealers in falsehood whose ignorance of the laws explained above makes them certain losers, and eventually they are punished and destroyed. By not knowing and following or obeying the laws governing the universe and rejecting or belying the laws of Islam conveyed to them as the true guidance for regulating their individual as well as collective life in this world they are surely heading unto disaster not only here but in the life of hereafter also because as explained above those who do not know the plan and purpose of creation or wilfully refuse to follow the truth even after knowing it, fact, disbelieve in the creator Lord of the worlds.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nHadith means discourse, statement, announcement or exposition. It indicates that the Quran is not uncreated.\n"

They were Christians. They offered him the fruits to eat. He recited bismillah before eating them, which prompted the curiosity of the two Christians. Then the Holy Prophet told them many events pertaining to Isa and his disciples. They became Muslims. After their departure the Holy Prophet offered his midnight prayer. At that time a group of jinn, passing by, heard him reciting the Quran. Verse 30 shows that they knew about the book of Musa, but they were impressed with the message of Islam and went back to their people to announce the good news.\nThe Holy Prophet invited all created beings to the worship of Allah. If any refuses to believe the truth, or opposes it, he will be deprived of His grace, mercy and protection, and will be left to go astray and wander in wilderness, helpless and disgraced. The opposition of the disbelievers has not the least effect on Allah's holy plan which goes on to its completion. It is stated in the Minhaj al Sadiqin that once the Holy Prophet took Ibn Masud with him to a cave where he recited surah al Falaq to the jinn. Ibn Masud saw a large gathering of huge birds and serpents. The Holy Prophet told him that nearly ten thousand jinn were there to listen to his recitation.\n"

In addition to the disbelievers, those also who came in the fold of Islam and worshipped Allah in the manner and style shown to them by the Holy Prophet concerning salat, sawm, zakat, hajj etcetera, but went against the commands of Allah and the Holy Prophet by not accepting the wilayah and imamah of Ali ibn abi Talib in order to establish a social order contrary to the principles laid down in the Quran, are not entitled to receive the reward of their deeds. In view of the deviation from and violation of the final and decisive settlement of the viceregency of the Holy Prophet, to be strictly followed by his followers after him, covenanted at Ghadir Khum (see commentary of Ma-idah: 67), they have forfeited the right to be called true Muslims. This deviation led to harassment, persecution and murder of the children of the Holy Prophet.\nAs stated above total submission to the will of Allah implies belief in His oneness (tawhid), in His book and in His messenger. A true believer accepts as true every verse revealed to the Holy Prophet, otherwise he will be in the position of a disbeliever. Therefore there is no escape from the consequences of the declaration made by the Holy Prophet at Ghadir Khum when verse 67 of al Ma-idah was revealed to him. Without the belief in Ali's wilayah and imamah, the faith is neither complete nor will it be accepted on the day of judgement.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe repeated reference to the belief in the Holy Prophet excludes the people of the book (Jews and Christians) from \"the believers\", though they may believe in Allah. because they do not believe in the final revelation (the Quran) revealed to the last messenger of Allah, the Holy Prophet.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 48:1]\nIn the sixth year of Hijra, the Holy Prophet had a dream that with his followers he made circuits round the Ka-bah, and performed all the ceremonies of hajj.\nSix years had passed since the Holy Prophet had left Makka. Islam had grown during these six years. The pagans had tried to attack the Holy Prophet at various times, but had been defeated. The Holy Prophet desired to perform the umrah in the month of Dhiqada, unarmed, but accompanied with his followers. A large following joined him, to the number of fifteen hundred. Early in the month, the Holy Prophet led his followers to Dhul Hulayfa on the road to Makka. They carried no arms but sheathed sword of a traveller. When they drew near to Makka, they were warned that Quraysh had gathered their allies against them, and that their cavalry under Khalid bin Walid was on the road before them, and with him was Ikrima bin Abu Jahl. As the Holy Prophet did not come to fight, he turned towards the right. At Hudaybiya his camel, Qaswa, stopped and knelt down. The Holy Prophet took it as a divine command and encamped there. There was no water there as the wells were choked up with sand. The Holy Prophet planted an arrow in one of the wells and the water immediately surfaced. The Quraysh sent three emissaries, one after the other, to enquire about his intentions. Urwa, a chief from Taif, said to the Holy Prophet that the Makkans were desperate and that they had resolved to die rather than allow him to enter. He also emphatically told him that as soon as the Makkans would fall upon his followers, they would run and desert him. At this Abu Bakr protested and resented the remark. The emissaries expressed their conviction in the sincerity of the Holy Prophet's intentions but the heathens did not listen to them. Kharrash bin Ummayya and Uthman were sent to the Quraysh but they could not convince them. They only agreed to allow Uthman, if he wished, to perform the rites of umrah.\nIn view of a possible confrontation, the Holy Prophet summoned all those with him and standing under a tree, took oath from each, of resolute adherence to him, never to flee from the battle field and to fight to the end. Refer to the verse 18 of this surah. This pledge is called \"The pledge under the tree\".\nMindful of the rout at the day of Khandaq at the hands of Ali the Makkans sent Suhayl bin Amr\nwith some other representatives to conclude a treaty of peace with the Holy Prophet as soon as they heard of the pledge under the tree. When the terms of the treaty were settled the Holy Prophet asked Ali, his vicegerent, to write down the terms of the treaty. Ali began with \"bismillahir rahmanir rahim\" but Suhayl said that it should begin as the Makkans used to do: Bismika Allahumma. The Holy Prophet agreed. Again when Ali wrote that \"This is the treaty made between Muhammad Rasullullah (the messenger of Allah) and Suhayl bin Amr\", Suhayl said that had they accepted Muhammad as the messenger of Allah they would not have taken arms against him, therefore \"Muhammad bin Abdullah\" should be written. Ali hesitated, then the Holy Prophet himself erased the word rasulullah and wrote bin Abdullah after his name, and told Ali that he would likewise face a similar situation in future. This prophecy came true when a treaty was concluded between Ali and Mu-awiyah after thirty years.\nThe following terms were put down in the treaty.\n(i) There shall be no aggression on the part of any of the two parties for the next ten years, neither shall attack the other or their allies.\n(ii) Whosoever wishes to join Muhammad and enter into a league with him shall have the liberty to do so. Likewise whoso wishes to join the Quraysh shall have the liberty to do so.\n(iii) If any one goes over to Muhammad and is claimed back by his guardian he shall be sent back; but if any one from the followers of Muhammad returns to the Quraysh, he shall not be sent back.\n(iv) Muhammad and his followers shall go back this year without entering the holy precincts.\n(v) Next year Muhammad and his followers may visit Makka for three days, when the Quraysh shall retire therefrom. They will not enter it with any arms, save with a traveller's sword.\nThe text was written by Ali and was witnessed by some of the most prominent companions.\nIt is mentioned in Sahih Bukhari, Tazkirat al Karim and Rawdat al Ahbab that Umar bin Khattab expressed himself plainly that he had never before suspected so strongly the truth of Muhammad being the messenger of Allah (it means he had doubted many times before); and said: \"Are you not a true messenger of Allah? Why should we then put a blot upon our faith and bear the brunt of humiliation if we are in the right and our adversaries in the wrong?\" The Holy Prophet replied: \"I am but a messenger of Allah and can do nothing against His will. He will help me.\"\nThe treaty of Hudaybiya, which though at the time seemed a set-back to the Muslims, proved in fact the greatest victory for Islam, moral and social, as well as political, and its lessons are expounded in this surah-victory comes from cool courage, devotion, faith and patience.\nBy virtue of this treaty every individual, each family, clan or tribe was given freedom of choice to join the Holy Prophet in his mission, to profess Islam and convince others to come into the fold of the religion of Allah without any risk of persecution from the disbelievers. Islam was making steady progress throughout the land.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 48:2]\nIf even a fleeting thought crosses the mind at the mention of \"sinning and being forgiven\" to connect it with the conduct of the Holy Prophet, it must be condemned as the worst form of blasphemy.\nIn the light of what has been written in the commentary of several verses so far studied, the sublime, superior-most and infallible nature of the Holy Prophet's being rules out any possibility, however far-fetched, of laying a sinful act on his doorstep.\nIn addition to other verses call to memory particularly the commentary of the following verses:\nFatihah: 6 and 7.\nBaqarah: 2, 30 to 39, 40, 78, 89, 124, 253, 285,\nAli Imran: 48, 81.\nBara-at: 105,\nBaniIsrail: 1,55.\nAhzab: 21, 33.\nMumin: 55.\nMuhammad: 15 and 19.\nIn the commentary of Mumin: 55 the issue of sinning and forgiveness has been thoroughly discussed and there is nothing to add here to reject the preposterous idea of attributing sinning to the Holy Prophet.\nVerses 2 to 9 of Najm alone are enough to establish the fact that if any one dares to slander the Holy Prophet with the outlandish conjecture that \"as, after all, he was a human being it was natural for him to make mistakes\", he is accusing Allah of making those mistakes.\nIn reality there are two schools of thought among his followers.\nOne school of thought follows the philosophy of the companions, among whom the shaykhayn (the first and the second caliph), Abu Sufyan and his son Mu-awiyah were very active in giving currency to the theory of \"Muhammd was a man like unto us\", which created so much confusion about the personality of the Holy Prophet that a large number of Muslims, in all ages, meekly surrender to whatever they have said about him. It was deliberately planned to bring the status of the Holy Prophet to the level of ordinary men so that the run of the mill rulers, whom they wanted to present as heroes of Islam, could be respected and honoured by the common people. To belittle the highest position of the Ahl ul Bayt, established by the sayings and doings of the Holy Prophet which have been mentioned by almost all the authors of traditions, history and tafsir, they found it imperative to spread the mist of incredibility around the infallible messenger of Allah, even by distorting and ignoring the clear and decisive verses of the Quran.\nThe point of view of the followers of \"Muhammad and ali (Ahl ul Bayt) of Muhammad\" has been clearly mentioned in the interpretation of all the relevant verses of the Quran. Verse 9 of Najm describes the nearness in perfection of the Holy Prophet to the absolute perfection of Allah as \"at a distance of two bows, or still nearer.\" What the \"still nearer\" implies is yet unknowable to man. It may have no frontiers. There is no limit to his nearness to Allah's perfection.\nAs has been mentioned in the commentary of Mumin: 55 and Muhammad: 15 and 19, Allah has granted protection to the followers of the Holy Prophet against their adversaries by the treaty of Hudaybiya. Two years later when the Holy Prophet entered Makka, after the unconditional surrender of the pagans, he had ten thousand men with him. A great victory it was indeed, surpassing all others in its far-reaching effects.\nThe interpretation of ghafir and zanb have been given in the commentary of Mumin: 55.\nThe sins of those who opposed the Holy Prophet but afterwards embraced Islam, and the sins of those who would, in future, oppose the religion of Allah but might become Muslims, would be forgiven, as also mentioned in Zumar: 35.\nFor the completion of Allah's favour refer to the commentary of Ma-idah: 3 and 67.\nGuiding the Holy Prophet to the right path after seventeen years of preaching the divine message is meaningless. The people are addressed here through the Holy Prophet, because the welfare of the people is the responsibility of the messenger of Allah. It refers to the guidance provided by Allah in the person of Ali, after the Holy Prophet, at Ghadir Khum, in order to secure the religion of Allah for ever from distortion and corruption.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAbout the messengers and prophets of Allah the Quran says:\n(i) They have been freed from any possibility of sinning.\n(ii) Shaytan has no authority over them.\n(iii) They follow nothing but revelation revealed to them by Allah.\n(iv) They are always on the right path. So every man prays to Allah to keep him on the path of His chosen representatives (Fatihah: 7).\n(v) Najm: 2 to 5 say:\n\"Your companion is not led astray, nor does he err, nor does he speak of his own inclination, it is naught but revelation revealed, taught him the mighty in power,\"\nThough the above verses refer to the Holy Prophet in particular, but they also cover all the prophets of Allah in general. Now if any sin is connected with them, the Quran would become an unreliable book.\nThe word zanb should be interpreted as the shortcomings necessitated by the nature of creation in all created beings, because Allah, the creator, is alone above and free of all inherent or intrinsic shortcomings. This is the fact towards which the Quran points out when it is said therein that Allah has freed His prophets from shortcomings and that the holy Ahl ul Bayt have been thoroughly purified, which is the result of ghafar (protection) He grants to His chosen servants.\nGhafir in this verse refers to the redress made available by His grace, otherwise victory in any sense cannot be the cause of forgiveness of any misdeed done under the influence of evil.\nZanb here refers to the state of mind of the Holy Prophet in view of the opposition of the disbelievers and the hypocrites to retard the progress of Islam, which came to an end by the decisive victory mentioned in verse one, political as well as spiritual. It is these kind of shortcomings which can be removed by the victory, or it can prevent its recurrence in future-the completion of Allah's favour on the Holy Prophet.\nAccording to the Ahl ul Bayt zanb, in this verse, means the sin of the people, not of the Holy Prophet.\n"

The love of Ali was enjoined to provide mankind with the ideal to be followed in every walk of life, material as well as spiritual. The Holy Prophet and Ali are from one and the same light, infallible and thoroughly purified. They never worshipped any ghayrallah (other than Allah). See commentary of Baqarah: 124.\nThere are forces at the command of Allah which, if directed, control the thoughts and feelings of the living beings in the universe and mobilise them to serve the fulfilment of the will of Allah.

In view of a possible confrontation those who were with him swore their fealty to him, by placing hand on hand according to the Arab custom. It was an impressive demonstration of surrender or submission of the will of every believer to the will of the Holy Prophet. It is also called bayt al ridwan (fealty which earns Allah's pleasure). Its another name is \"bayt taht-ush-shajarrah\" (fealty under the tree) as stated in the commentary of verse 1. They placed their hands on the Holy Prophet's hand, but the hand of Allah was above them-He accepted their fealty.\n\"Whosoever breaks his oath, does so to the harm of his own soul\" indicates that the oath of allegiance will be broken.

In Shawwal, 6 Hijra, the Jews of Khaybar began a fresh campaign to launch an attack against the Holy Prophet and his followers. Therefore in Muharram, 7 Hijra, he undertook an expedition against them to put an end to their plots. The Jews rallied round their chief, the king of their nation, named Kinana. He lived in a strongly fortified citadel of Khaybar named al Qamus. The siege of al Qamus was the most trying task for the Muslims, who had never before forced their way into such a stronghold. Abul Fida writes in Tarikh Abul Fida that the Holy Prophet handed over his standard to Abu Bakr directing him to lead the assault, but he was vigorously repulsed by the Jews and forced to retreat. Next the Holy Prophet sent Umar bin Khattab, but the result was no better than a forced retreat (Tabari; Sirat Muhammadiya, Rawdat al Ahbab; Tarikh al Khamis). The soldiers, coming back to the Holy Prophet, charged their leader, Umar, with cowardice, while Umar blamed them of lack of courage (Tabari; Sirat Muhammadiya).\nThen the Holy Prophet said:\n\"Tomorrow I shall give my flag to one who loves Allah and His Prophet, and who is the beloved of Allah and His Prophet, a fearless constant charger who never turns his back upon a foe, at his hands the Lord will give victory.\" (Waqidi, Bukhari; Muslim; Ahmad bin Hanbal, Nasa-i, Tirmidhi; Tabari; Ibn Athir and Suyuti).\nEveryone of the Holy Prophet's chief companions was anxious to be signalised on the morrow as the \"beloved of Allah and His Prophet.\" No one thought of Ali, the ever victorious hero of all the previous wars, the vicegerent of the Holy Prophet, because, suffering with sore eyes, he was not present (Tabari; Tarikh al Khamis).\nThe Holy Prophet, however, as commanded by Allah, recited Nadi Ali:\n\"Call on Ali,\n(He) is able to bring about the extraordinary.\nYou will find him an effective supporter in all calamities.\n(All) worries and sorrows will soon disappear.\nO Ali, O Ali, O Ali.\"\nAs soon as the Holy Prophet called Ali, he appeared on the scene. The Holy Prophet, taking Ali's head into his lap, applied the saliva of his mouth to his eyes. At once his eyes become so clear as if he had not suffered from the disease at all (Ibn Hisham; Tabari; Nasa-i).\nThen he gave his sacred banner into the hands of Ali, and thus Ali became the beloved of Allah and the Holy Prophet (Ibn Hisham; Tabari etcetera). The Holy Prophet told Ali: \"Go and conquer the fort\".\nTo provide guidance to the people in every age the Holy Prophet, under the command of Allah, gave every opportunity to his senior most companions to prove their abilities, but they failed, and their failure is recorded in the history for ever.\nA Jewish monk, when he came to know that the name of the new commander was Ali, told his men that it was mentioned in their scripture that a man named Elia would conquer the fort of Khaybar. Harith, a Jewish champion, who had successfully repulsed the attacks of Abu Bakr and Umar, stepped forward to meet Ali in single combat. Ali slew him. The brother of Harith, Marhab, was a man of gigantic stature. He was unequalled in valour among the Jews. To avenge the death of his brother, he came out, covered with a double coat of mail, with a huge sword and a big spear with triple-forked sharp pointed heads.\n\"I am Marhab ,\" he cried, \"as all Khaybar knows, a warrior bristling with arms in a furiously raging war.\"\nAli advanced in response to his challenge and said:\n\"I am he whom his mother named Hayder, a lion of the wilderness.\"\nAs they came near each other, Marhab thrust his three-pronged lance at Ali, missed and lost concentration and balance for a brief moment, and before he could recover, Ali dealt him a blow with the dhulfiqar, which passed through his iron head-gear, skull, head, chest and body down to his saddle, severing him in two equal parts. \"Allahu Akbar\", said Ali and all knew that Ali was victorious. When Harith, Marhab, Antar, Rabi-i, Dajij, Dawd, Morra and Yasir, the most distinguished Jew warriors, were killed by Ali, the Jews retreated into the fort and closed its huge iron gate. Ali jumped over a trench and wrenched the door of the irongate off its hinges and used it as a sheild. In some traditions it is reported that he spread the door over the trench as a bridge to make easy the entry of the Muslim soldiers into the fort. It is mentioned in Sirat Ibn Hisham, Tarikh Kamil and Tarikh Abul Fida that, after the war, several men tried to turn it over but failed. This is the \"sign\" referred to in this verse for the guidance of the believers unto the right path.\nAfter the conquest of al Qamus, the remaining strongholds capitulated and their lands were subjected to a tax of half of the produce. When the inhabitants of Fadak gave their land to the Holy Prophet verse 26 of Bani Israil: \"Give to the near of kin that which is due,\" was revealed. Ibn Hisham, Tabari, Zarqani and Abul Fida say that as the income from Fadak belonged wholly to the Holy Prophet on account of its being given to him without use of force, he gave it to Bibi Fatimah (Kanzal Ammal by Ali Muttaqi). Refer to the commentary of Bani Israil: 26; Naml: 15, 16; Nahl: 90 and Maryam: 2 to 15 for the issue of Fadak.\nWhile the Holy Prophet was at Khaybar, an attempt at his life was made by a Jewess, daughter of Harith, who dressed a lamb, poisoned it with a deadly poison and sent it as a gift when the evening repast was being served to him. As soon as the Holy Prophet took a bite of the meat he knew at once that it was poisoned, so he spat it forth. Bishr bin Bara, in the meantime, swallowed some of it and at once fell down and died without even stirring his limbs. The poison was so deadly that, though it only touched the Holy Prophet's tongue, it slowly spread to his neck. During his sickness, before his departure from this world, when the mother of Bishr came to see him, he told her that the same poison, which killed her son, was now killing him.\nThus the death of the Holy Prophet occurred as a martyr.\n"

This implies that no irreverence should be shown to either Allah or His Prophet in any matter.

It is not allowed to give advice in any matter before the Holy Prophet asks a believer to do so, if he pleases. Obey Allah and His Prophet in every matter, small or great; in the whole conduct of your life.\nJudgement or verdict is given by Allah in all matters through His messenger. So obey and revere the Holy Prophet as you should obey and revere Allah. Some ill-mannered companions used to show positive disrespect to the Holy Prophet by their behaviour. Bad manners and rudeness destroy the value of any services which have been rendered. Those who had true piety in their hearts really and sincerely respected, honoured and revered their leader. Those who did the opposite surely undid the work of years by weakening the leader's authority. See commentary of Nisa: 65 and always keep in mind the person who said about the Holy Prophet:\n\"The old man is in a delirium. The book of Allah is sufficient for us.\"\nApart from the derogatory comment on the infallible messenger of Allah which had rendered all his deeds null and void, his ignorance of the book of Allah had also become known to the whole world. It is because of such \"wandering in the darkness of ignorance\", the Holy Prophet had advised his followers to refer to his Ahl ul Bayt whenever they desire to understand the true meanings of the verses of the Quran (see hadith al thaqalayn on page 6). So think twice before following such ignorant and self conceited persons as your leaders who ridiculed and slandered the Holy Prophet, when even walking ahead of him or beside him, or talking loud before him or interposing while he is speaking, has been prohibited .\nIt is reported in a tradition mentioned in Sahih Bukhari that a group of men of Qa-aqa came to the Holy Prophet; and before he could give his verdict, Abu Bakr proposed Qa-aqa bin Mu-ud and Umar suggested Qara to be appointed as the leader of the group. Then they began to dispute with each other on that issue. So these verses were revealed to establish the supreme authority of the Holy Prophet.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nUnwarranted interference in the issues of religion already decided by the Holy Prophet emerged in full force after his departure from the world and continues in every age.\nThe occasion of revelation shows that the most prominent companions of the Holy Prophet indulged in what has been forbidden in these verses.\nBukhari says:\n\"The two good men were very near (a certain) perdition\" (Kadal khayyiran an yahlika)\nNotwithstanding this reprimand, according to Bukhari, disrespectful behaviour of the companions continued and lasted till the Holy Prophet's departure. The well known tradition of qirtas throws sufficient light on the ignorance of the companions.\nVerse 3 mentions the men of sublime character around the Holy Prophet who are referred to in order to distinguish good from evil, because behaviour unto the Holy Prophet has been made a test of the faith of his followers.\n"

The truth was found out and this verse was revealed to condemn Walid, a companion of the Holy Prophet, and men like him who are ready to shed innocent blood on mere guesswork. In the reign of Uthman Walid was appointed as the governor of Kufa.

Allah has made them to vary in colour, language and mode of life, and has placed them in different lands, but before Him they are all one and cherished by Him alike, and he is most honoured who is most righteous.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Do not take pride in superior birth, tribe or nation.\"\nEven the descendants of the Holy Prophet, known as sharif or sayyid, have been forbidden to give themselves airs on account of their relationship with him because it will not save them from punishment on the day of judgement if they have transgressed the boundaries laid down by Allah.\nImam Ali bin Husayn Zaynal Abidin said:\n\"The hell has been made ready for those who disobey Allah, be he a most important person in the society; and only those who obey Allah will go into paradise, be he a slave.\"\nIt is reported that a Muslim bought a slave who appealed to the people gathered in the auction square that he who was ready to allow him to pray behind the Holy Prophet should buy him, and the slave was always in the rows formed behind the Holy Prophet. After a few days the Holy Prophet noticed his absence. He went to his place. He was sick. After three days he died. The Holy Prophet personally attended to his funeral rites, bathed him, gave him a shroud and buried him. When mahajirs and ansar showed signs of astonishment this verse was revealed.\nIt is said that once the disciples of Isa asked him as to who was to be considered as superior among men. Isa took a handful of dust in his hand and said:\n\"All man are from the dust and they shall return to dust. In the eyes of God he is most honoured who is most righteous.\"\nThis verse renders null and void all distinctions based on race, colour, caste and social position. Taqwa (obedience to Allah and His laws) is the only criterion for superiority or honour.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"No man is superior to another on account of race or colour, taqwa (wisdom and piety) alone is the distinction.\"\nIn this way man finds his individual as well as collective freedom, material progress and spiritual happiness, peace and order in Islam.\nTo have an idea of taqwa refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 2 to 5 and 177.

The lip-profession was resorted to because of many advantages available to the Muslims.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nReal submission to the will of Allah creates iman (conviction which enters and abides in the heart). So those who say: \"We submit,\" can be called Muslims but they are not mumins, whereas mumin is necessarily a muslim. Islam is the outer circle and iman is the inner core. Islam is submission and iman is the full realisation of the faith with complete conviction. Both can be verbal declaration without conviction, and both can be from the bottom of the heart, real and sincere.\nFor a full description of a true mumin for whom verse 13 assigns superiority and honour see commentary of Baqarah: 177 and Bara-at: 119.\n"

On whomsoever's house it will come upon will be my heir, my successor, and he is the divinely commissioned guide.\" The star descended on Ali's house. The hypocrites began to whisper that in love of Ali the Holy Prophet had gone astray. On this occasion these verses were revealed. The Holy Prophet is mentioned as sahib (companion) because he was living among the people addressed in this verse.\n\"He does not speak of his own will\" has also been mentioned in Deuteronomy 18: 18-:\n\"Then the Lord said to me (Musa) :\"I will raise up for them a prophet like you, one of their own race, and I will put my words into his mouth. He shall convey all my commands to them.\"\nIt is also mentioned in John 16: 18:\n(Isa said): \"However, when he comes who is the spirit of truth, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but will tell only what he hears; and he will make known to you the things that are coming.\"\nThe Holy Prophet was always in communion with Allah. Whatever he said was the word of Allah and\nhis actions were the fulfilment of the divine will, yet at the time of the treaty of Hudaybiya his close companion had doubts about his prophethood despite many verses of the Quran which assert that which has been said in verse 2 to 4, and his reputation as the most trustworthy and truthful among the people of Makka.

As mentioned in the commentary of the verses of al Baqarah, on the authority of well known Muslim scholars. (Refer to Durr al Manthur, Kanzul Ammal, Yanabi al Mawaddat, Riaz al Nuzra and Arjah al Mutalib), \"the names\" were-Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn. Even if \"the names\" are interpreted as wisdom, then too Jibrail cannot be the teacher of the Holy Prophet, as the Holy Prophet is the superior most prophet among all the prophets of Allah in wisdom and all other attributes. In verse 75 of Sad Allah asks Shaytan: \"Are you arrogant, or are you one of the alin (the high ones)?\" It means there were some servants of Allah described as alin (plural of ali) who were superior to Adam, therefore, exempted from prostrating themselves before Adam on account of their superiority over him. So it is proved that it is Allah who taught the Holy Prophet and from no mortal created being he received any kind of knowledge as mentioned in the commentary of Baqarah: 78 and other verses in connection with the interpretation of the word \"ummi\"."

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 53:6]\nRefer to the commentary of Bani Israil: 1 for mi-raj (ascension). The Holy Prophet held in view the entire universe from the highest position, where he found Jibrail. Then the Holy Prophet drew near to Allah \"till a distance of two bows or still nearer.\" The nearness described by \"still nearer\" cannot be imagined by human mind. It is the nearest nearness possible between the finite and the infinite. Arabic idiom qaba qawsayn indicate extreme nearness. \"The drawn bows, with their chords touching,\" make a circle of union, yet the Holy Prophet is not to be considered as totally absorbed into divinity. The nearness stands for the highest position of the Holy Prophet in the order of creation-the nearest to Allah. It was a custom among the Arabs that when two individuals joined their bows it implied that both of them were united or bound by an agreement to shoot their arrows simultaneously in one direction.\nFatadalla implies that the Holy Prophet brought himself low in utmost humility before the manifest glory of the Lord of the worlds to express his gratitude for the unique divine grace bestowed on him.\nFor all the details of ascension (mi-raj) see commentary of Bani Israil: 1.\nThe nature of communion with Allah at their nearest point is incommunicable and incomprehensible to any one who is not from the Holy Prophet.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nVerses I to 8 assert the infallibility of the Holy Prophet in his movement between the creator and the creation, similar to the movement of the star in its orbit. He neither deviates nor does or say anything other than what is revealed to him. The degree of his realisation and knowledge of all that which has been created is as perfect as the creator, save the finest span between the finite and the infinite.\nThe first degree of realisation he reached is the scene of istiwa in the highest part of the horizon which is the highest stage of the angelic force, at which appear the two arcs-the arc of creation and the arc of godhead-to meet each other. Here the Holy Prophet and Jibrail heard a voice (saying):\n\"Glory be to Me. I am the Lord of the angels and the spirits. My mercy subdues My wrath.\"\nThen moving further beyond the dualistic view, he entered the state of awaiting or pending (not terminated) between the finite and the infinite, joining point of the two arcs, after which comes the phase of aw adna where all dualistic considerations concerning the two arcs disappear. The whole becomes a circle wherein the absolute infinite manifests overall encompassment and penetration. At this stage of total submission and absorption, the Holy Prophet comes into direct communion with the infinite absolute and receives most important message which is known to him and his Lord.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq said:\n\"It was in this state the command relating to wilayah or imamah with finality was revealed to the Holy Prophet.\"\nThe Imam further said that \"what he saw\" has nothing to do with the ordinary sense of seeing but it refers to the realisation the cognitive self of the Holy Prophet achieved.\nHawa, in the sense of inclination, implies that the stars in their movement are inclined to either go up or down. As their movement is regular, it becomes a guidance for mankind. The Quran draws man's attention to the conduct of the Holy Prophet which is nothing but carrying out the commands of Allah in letter and spirit-a guidance to mankind to find the right path in the darkness of worldly wanderings and temptations.\nThe assertion made in verses 2 to 4 concerning his life in this world is not restricted to any particular event, aspect or period but applies to his entire life from the day he came in this world to the day he departed. Ali ibn abi Talib in the Nahj al Balagha describes the infallibility and the unique excellences of the Holy Prophet in the highest form of style and substance ever thought or said by any one till today"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 55:3]\nRefer to the commentary of Baqarah: 30 to 38; Hijr: 26 to 29 and Sajdah: 9. The first man, Adam, was created pure, free from sin. Verse 9 of Hijr says that Allah breathed His spirit (ruh) into man (Adam), so he reflected divinity which carried knowledge originating from the beneficent Lord as stated in verse 31 of al Baqarah-Allah taught Adam \"the names\" (the actuality of the panjatan), the source of knowledge of all things. According to verse 59 of An-am the knowledge of everything, wet or dry, is in the Quran. This is the man who has been referred to in verse 3. Sinning was introduced to man by Iblis after man's creation. Allah asked the angels to prostrate before Adam after breathing His spirit into him. The prostration was not made before the body of Adam but before the spirit of Allah which carried life or existence (hayat), knowledge (ilm) and authority (qudrat). As the angels did not have the knowledge taught to Adam, the command to accept Adam's superiority was just. It means that the integration of divine faculties in Adam took place because of the spirit of Allah which purified him. Adam was the grand sire of the thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt mentioned in Ahzab: 33.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"I was the prophet of Allah when Adam was yet in the (womb) of water and clay.\nIt was my light (nur) which Allah created before all creation.\"\nThus \"man\" (insan) referred to in this verse is the divinely conditioned, integrated and perfected being of the Holy Prophet. It was this original purity of the Holy Prophet which, when was invested with Adam, entitled him to receive obeisance from the angels. The Holy Prophet's light passed through the progeny of Adam, manifested in the messengers and prophets of Allah, and reached Abdul Muttalib. Then it bifurcated into his two sons Abdullah and Abu Talib; and from Abdullah it manifested in Muhammad and from Abu Talib it manifested in Ali.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"I and Ali are from one and the same light.\"\nThen again these two rays of the divine light were united, through Ali and Fatimah, and manifested in Hasan, Husayn and the nine Imams in their progeny mentioned in the commentary of Baqarah :124.\nThe light of the perfected man, the Holy Prophet, carried wisdom, purity and authority and manifested them in the chain of prophets as mentioned above. Verse 14 of Ala and verse 9 of Shams say: \"He indeed will succeed who cleanses (purifies) himself.\" So those who desire to attain success have to attach themselves to the thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt and follow their teachings and life pattern. Any deviation from them will lead to pollution, evil and wickedness. Bayan means intelligent speech, power of expression, capacity to understand clearly the relations of things and revelation in nature and to explain them. The revelation given to man through prophets is the highest example of bayan as verse 138 of Ali Imran asserts. The Quran (bayan) the Holy Prophet recited to mankind has no equal. Refer to Baqarah: 23; Yunus: 37 and 38; Hud: 13; Bani Israil: 88 and Tur: 34.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nMan has been endowed with the faculties of contemplation and expression. The degree and the time of development of these endowments distinguishes one man from another. In prophets and their divinely chosen successors they are found in fully developed form from the day they are created. According to Najm: 1 to 10 the Holy Prophet, as the manifestation of the universal beneficence, precedes and surpasses all the messengers and prophets of Allah.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq said that bayan is the greatest name of Allah, through which everything is known. It implies that man reflects whatever he receives from the divine source.\n"

This fact of order and harmony prevailing in the working of universe was made known to man at a time when only conjectures and superstitions prevailed.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 55:46]\nThese verses describe the state of bliss the God-fearing will enjoy in a number of allegories.\nThe two springs are known as Tasnim and Salsabil.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAll sorts of fruits in pairs correspond to various aspects of (i) faith and (ii) good deeds.\nVERSE 60:\nThis is the summing up of all the symbolism used to express the bliss of the eternal life in paradise, the best expression that can be given to the idea of equity.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nEach blessing in the life of hereafter corresponds to some good done in this world. Ayyashi narrates from Imam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq that the standard principle stated in this verse applies to every man, believer or disbeliever. To whomsoever good is done, he must return it with good with more good if he wants to have an edge over the man who took the first step to do good to him. This principle is also operative between the creator and the created beings, save that the creator free from all needs, does not need any favours.\nVERSE 62:\nWhatever a dweller of paradise desires it will be made available to him or her-blessings and blessings, more and more, with no limitations.\nAbu Basir asked Imam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq: \"Will a pious believing couple remain united in the paradise if both the husband and wife desire so?\" The Imam said: \"If the quality of piety and faith of husband is better, he will have the option, and if the quality of the piety and faith of the wife is better, she will have the option. If one desires the other they will certainly live together.\" There will be grades in the living conditions of the dwellers of paradise according to the quality of their faith and deeds. It is said that the people of higher regions will be allowed to visit the comparatively lower parts, but the residents of the lower parts will be unable to visit higher regions."

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 56:7]\nThere will be a sorting out of good and evil. There will be three main classes: (i) The people of the right hand are those who made mistakes but turned in repentance to Allah within reasonable time and thereafter lived a pious life. Their rewards are described in verses 27 to 40. (ii) The people of the left hand are those who did not believe in Allah, His book and His last Prophet lived in sin and died in disbelief. Their agony and torment is described in verses 41 to 56. (iii) \"The foremost in faith\" are those who were always the quickest and readiest to accept Allah's message and to give life, property and position in the service of Allah. They reached the highest degree in submission to Allah's will and spiritual understanding, such as the messengers and prophets of Allah and their divinely chosen successors. Refer to the commentary of Bara-at: 100 and Saffat: 40.\nWhen the Holy Prophet made known his mission Ali ibn abi Talib and Khadijah Kubra were the foremost in accepting the truth. They were the first two who prayed salat behind the Holy Prophet. Refer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 52 and 53 for the event of \"the feast of the relatives\". Ali was the first man who agreed to help the Holy Prophet in his mission and throughout his life fulfilled his undertaking. The commentary of several verses so far read by you confirm the historical facts that in Badr, Uhad, Khandaq, Khaybar, Hunayn and all the battles the Holy Prophet had to fight in self defence Ali was not only in the forefront but also the exclusive hero who won every battle he fought. The commentary of Baqarah: 124 makes clear the fact that he alone was the person who did not worship any ghayrullah (other than Allah) and in wisdom, mercy and guidance he was with the Holy Prophet all the time.\nAhmad bin Hanbal says in his Musnad that the foremost in faith were three men (i) mumin of ali Firawn (ii) mumin of ali Ya Sin (iii) Ali ibn abi Talib.\nThe well-known commentator, Thalabi, reports on the authority of Ibn Abbas that Ali ibn abi Talib said: \"I am the servant of Allah, the brother of the Holy Prophet, the siddiq al akbar, the greatest testifier (of the Holy Prophet), He who claims this title is an impostor.\" Therefore Ali is the highest example of the foremost (sabiqun). There are others according to the degree they attain. Those who spent a long life in worship of idols, and even after accepting Islam, ran away from the battles, deserting the Holy Prophet, and deviated from the path shown by him can never be included in the category of the foremost.\nImam Ali said:\n\"The Holy Prophet told me that my devotees (shi-ahs) will be the first to enter the paradise.\"\nThe devotees of Ali are those who reflect Ali's character (like Salman and Abu Dhar). The light of faith will make their faces radiant on the day of resurrection. They will be nearest to Allah, enjoying the highest bliss.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe people of \"the right hand\" in verse 8 are those who incline towards the absolute, and the people of \"the left hand\" in verse 9 are those who incline towards the illusory gains, and the foremost in verse 10 are those whose obedience to the absolute is total and exclusive. Refer to my note in the commentary of Maryam: 71. These are those referred to in Anbiya: 101 (freed from all afflictions in the hereafter), in Fatir: 32 (the inheritors of the book).\nThe number of the foremost between the time of Adam and the advent of the Holy Prophet are many because in the terms sabiqun and muqarrabun (the foremost and the nearest to Allah) all the prophets and their divinely commissioned successors (awsiya) are included.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"The guides (leaders) after me are twelve\".\nTherefore the foremost among the followers of the Holy Prophet are very few.\nAccording to Sahih Bukhari, the Holy Prophet said:\n\"He who does not recognise the Imam of his age and leaves this world dies the death of ignorance.\"\nIn verse 34 furush literally means carpet, or anything spread on the ground. In Dhariyat: 48 it has been used for the earth. Figuratively it has been used here for wives as the Holy Prophet has used it when he said: \"The child belongs to the farash (bed-wife) and the wife belongs to the husband.\"\nVerse 35 supports this interpretation.\nThe reward and punishment, the pleasure and torment, are described in terms of the physical world. The physical world is the manifestation of the spiritual world. The enjoyments and torments described in the terms of the physical world are figurative to give an idea of the real world.\nSee my note in the commentary of Maryam: 61.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 56:77]\nAll shades of meanings associated with the word \"karim\" are applicable. The Quran gives out, imparts, makes available openhandedly knowledge, justice, mercy, awareness of laws made by Allah, relationship between man and God, and interrelation among all that has been created, in all directions, covering every aspect and dimension.\nThe maknun (hidden, precious, well-guarded) Quran in the lawh mahfuz is beyond the reach of earthly understanding, based upon empirical conclusions. Only the thoroughly purified, mentioned in Azhab: 33, come in contact or achieve real contact with its true meaning (refer to Ali Imran: 7), sense, grasp and handle (various meanings of the word mass) the real purport of the word of Allah. Refer to the commentary of Ahzab :33.\nThe Quran is amidst the people, sent by the beneficent Lord, to give guidance to whosever seeks it as promised in verse 69 of Ankabut, but in the light of hadith al thaqalayn (on page 6) the Holy Prophet made it clearly known that unless the seeker of guidance comes to his Ahl ul Bayt, he will not find it.\nVerse 78 says that the Quran is treasured and preserved in a well guarded book (maknun) implying that it is the recitation which is in our hands, not the actual book. In support verses 3 and 4 of Zukhruf say: \"Verily, We have made it an Arabic Quran that you may haply understand. Verily it is in the mother (of the) book with Us, the most exalted, full of wisdom.\" According to Shu-ara: 192 to 194 it was sent down to the heart of the Holy Prophet through the trusted spirit. It was taught to the Holy Prophet by Allah as per Najam: 5. Ankabut: 49 says that the Quran, a collection of clear or manifest signs or verses, is treasured in the hearts of those who are endowed with divine wisdom-the Holy Prophet and his thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt. Therefore the well-guarded book preserved in the lawh mahfuz (also described in Anam: 59) was known to the Holy Prophet, and from the heart of the Holy Prophet this heavenly treasure was transferred to the twelve Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt, the thoroughly purified.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\n(i) According to Buruj: 21 and 22 the Quran has a pre-revealed existence in the lawh mahfuz (the preserved tablet).\n(ii) This existence is not material or physical, knowable to human senses.\n(iii) The nature of this existence is spiritual and intellectual, so the word mass cannot refer to the sense of touch. It implies intellectual grasp because the inseparable pronoun in objective case (yamassuhu) either refers to the maknun book or the Quran which is hidden in the maknun book.\n(iv) The clause la yamassuhu should be taken as purely of indicative and not of imperative significance.\n(v) If there is a tradition which prohibits impure persons to touch the revealed version of the Quran, it should be taken as an imperative based on the indicative preposition as has been pointed out in the commentary of Saffat: 102-Ibrahim told Ismail his dream in an indicative form but Ismail treated the indicative as imperative.\n(vi) The phrase al mutahharun (the purified) does not refer to those who purify themselves by a material purifying agent or by embracing Islam. In Abasa: 13 to 16 and Bayyinah: 2 and 3 this phrase has been used for purifying the book by Allah Himself. In Baqarah: 25 it is used to describe the wives purified by Allah.\n(vii) The physical touch is partial because the surface of one thing touches the surface of another thing. In the case of intellectual touch the knower grasps the known in such a way that the known, the knowing and the knower become identifiable with each other. It is a total touch.\n(viii) As the term touch requires, the toucher and the touched should be of the same class, otherwise the touch or grasp would be not possible.\n(ix) Taking into consideration all these arguments, many commentators have said that the word mutahharun refers to the angels, accepting the principle that touching of the Quran in its original state of \"well guarded tablet\" is possible only if the toucher has been purified. Now if the application of the term is confined to the angels, the superior status given to man by Allah-He has appointed him as His vicegerent and commanded the angels to prostrate before him (see commentary of Baqarah: 30 to 39)-will be brought low which amounts to rebellion against Allah; particularly when Allah has thoroughly purified a group of human beings, the Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet, by His will and command in verse 33 of Ahzab. These verses are inseparably linked with Ahzab: 33. On the basis of all these verses the Holy Prophet joined the Quran and his Ahl ul Bayt together (see hadith al thaqalayn on page 6) so that guidance, mercy and knowledge be available to mankind in all ages.\nThe Quran and sunnah, in unequivocal terms, have asserted the infallibility of the Ahl ul Bayt as well as the book of Allah.\n"

If surrender is made due to helplessness or under compulsion, the surrenderer follows a given pattern, and in the course of following realises the wisdom and the grace ingrained in the pattern and fortifies the authority controlling all activities. If the submission or surrender is voluntary, the surrenderer follows a model pattern, in thought and action, by exercising freedom of choice and discretion after knowing the wisdom and grace ingrained in the suggested pattern, and willingly keeps himself away from the loss and straying if the said pattern is rejected. The willing and voluntary surrender to reap the harvest of order, harmony, justice and welfare is Islam. The mission of guidance is to present and manifest the suggested pattern, in theory and practice, to let every man use his faculties of understanding and discretion, given to him by Allah, to see the light, distinguish between good and evil, right and wrong, truth and falsehood (see commentary of Baqarah: 256), and then make a choice of the right path. With the wisdom and insight he develops by following true guides (the Holy Prophet, his Ahl ul Bayt and the Quran) he is in a position to avoid sealing of his eyes, ears and heart or mind with falsehood and prejudice as stated in the various verses of the book of Allah, which inevitably lead to destruction, deprivation and punishment. This voluntary course of action brings him into the fold of the accepted religion of Allah preached by the Holy Prophet. See Baqarah: 112, Ali Imran: 19; Nisa: 125 and Maidah: 3.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 57:19]\nThose who believe in Allah should also believe in the Holy Prophet. The belief in the Holy Prophet is essential. By accepting the prophetship of the Holy Prophet the faith in the unity of Allah is established. To demonstrate and manifest belief in the Holy Prophet the believer must submit himself unconditionally to the Holy Prophet and obey his commands, because it is Allah (Najm 2 to 5) who speaks, commands and acts through him. The devotion of the believers to the Holy Prophet should be total in every walk of life and at all events. Any doubt, deviation or desertion reflects hypocrisy. So when a believer believes in Allah and the Holy Prophet and demonstrates his belief with unconditional surrender to their will and command he becomes siddiq (truthful) and shahid (witness). For the perfect example of the truthful refer to the commentary of Bara-at: 119. The authentic books concur in reporting that this verse (Bara-at: 119) refers to the Ahl ul Bayt. See Hafiz Abu Nu-aym; Muwaffaq ibn Ahmed; and Ibn Hajar in his Sawa-iq al Muriqah, chapter 11, page 90.\nFor the witness refer to the commentary of Rad: 43 and Hud: 17. There are other truthfuls and witnesses in the sense referred to in this verse according to the degree of their submission to Allah and His prophet, but the highest and perfect degree of truthfulness and testification is found in the Ahl ul Bayt.\nAccording to Luqman: 13 polytheism is the greatest injustice. Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 124 to know that there was none among the companions of the Holy Prophet who had not worshipped a ghayrallah; and after becoming Muslim they can be described as pardoned idolaters. Even after embracing Islam most of them used to abandon and desert the Holy Prophet at the slightest hint of defeat or destruction (see commentary of Bara-at: 25 to 27) or had doubts in his prophethood (see commentary of Fat-h: 1).\nThose who proved the truth, by suppressing their mortal egotism in order to let their individuality merge into the eternal, universal and absolute supreme being so as to reflect His authority, wisdom and mercy, are in fact the witnesses referred to in this verse. Their life pattern became the proof of the divine attributes. They gave their lives, property and children in the cause of Allah which was not possible without a sure conviction in the omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient existence of the supreme being. They were the living example of the following verse:\n\"Verily my worship, my sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds (Anam: 163)\nThey are the thoroughly purified Ahl ul Bayt of the Holy Prophet (Ahzab: 33) whom the Holy Prophet presented to the world as his \"selves, children and women\" (Ali Imran: 61). They are the ideal guides for mankind in all ages.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAyyashi narrates that once a disciple of Imam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq requested him to pray to Allah to bless him with martyrdom. The Imam said: \"Every true believer is a martyr.\" Then he recited this verse. He further observed: \"Whoever recognises the true vicegerents of Allah and sincerely expects that ultimately they shall take charge of the kingdom of Allah, is like him who fought with the Holy Prophet and gave his life in the cause of Allah in the presence of the Holy Prophet.\"\n"

Those who love the pleasures of this world are delighted with the green of the growth, which soon withers, becomes dry and crumbles to pieces, like the worldly pleasures, pomps, boastings and possessions. The good men take the real spiritual harvest and store it for the hereafter.\nOnce the Holy Prophet drew the attention of his companions to the swollen, rotten and stinking dead body of a goat lying on the ground, and asked them if any of them would buy it for a penny. All refused. Then he said: \"The value of the worldly possessions is lower than this corpse.\"\nImam Ali said:\n\"The world is a corpse. Whoever seeks it is a dog.\"\n\"O Ammar, grieve not if the pleasures of this world are kept away from you.\nHoney, the best and sweetest food, is the saliva of an insect, the bee.\nThe nicest dress is made of silk which is the refuse of a small worm.\nThe most refreshing scent, musk, is the blood of an animal, the deer.\nThe best drink is water which is also used by animals to quench their thirst.\nThe most passionate act is cohabiting in which urinative organs are used.\"\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"This world is a prison for the believers, and a garden for the disbelievers.\"\n\"Treat this world as a land to cultivate harvest for the hereafter.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThis world is a test, and the life hereafter is its consequence-punishment or reward.\n"

In \"the party of Allah\" only those who possess highest degree of purity of body and soul are included as the entire Muslim ummah knows beyond all doubts that verse 61 of Ali Imran, verse 33 of Ahzab and verse 23 of Shura refer to the Ahl ul Bayt exclusively.\n(ii) The quality of faith in Allah referred to here could not be had by those who deserted the Holy Prophet in the battlefields (Bara-at: 25 to 27), or watched the battles from a safe distance (Baqarah: 214, 251; Ahzab: 1 to 3 and 9 to 27), or always had doubts about the religion of Allah and the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (Fat-h: 1), or refused to obey the commands of the Holy Prophet (Nisa: 65). Such people show lack of faith and courage in the hour of trial because they do not believe in the life of hereafter or \"the last day\". Those who firmly believe in the life of hereafter do not usurp temporal power by hook or crook, nor undeservedly occupy the seat of leadership.\nImam Ali said:\n\"O yellow gold, O white silver, do not waste your glamour on me. Beguile others. I have divorced you thrice. Now there is no link between us.\"\n(iii) When \"Allah has inscribed faith in their hearts\", there remains no chance whatsoever that they may have doubts about the religion of Allah and the prophethood of the Holy Prophet. He who had doubted (Fat-h: 1) obviously has not been favoured with the divine blessing of \"faith inscribed in his heart\".\n(iv) He who is \"strengthened with a spirit\" from Allah, rises to the heights of courage, bravery and glory seen by the whole world in the battles of Badr, Uhad, Khandaq, Hunayn and Khaybar, or on the night of hijrat. See commentary of Ali Imran : 13 and Anfal: 5; Ali Imran: 121 to 168 and Anfal: 16; Baqarah: 214, 251 and Ahzab: 1 to 3, 9 to 27; Bara-at: 25 to 27; Fat-h: 20; and Baqarah: 207 and Anfal: 30.\nA few exclusive merits of Ali ibn abi Talib, written by Jalal al Din al Suyuti in Tarikh al Khulafa, are given below:\n(i) Ahmad bin Hanbal says: \"There had not come down to us regarding the merits of any one of the companions of the Holy Prophet what has been transmitted concerning Ali.\" (Al Hakim).\n(ii) Ibn Asakir from Ibn Abbas says: \"There has not been revealed in the book of Allah regarding any one what has been revealed concerning Ali and that 300 verses have been revealed concerning Ali.\"\n(iii) Al Tabarani and Ibn Abi Hatim record from Ibn Abbas that he said: \"The Lord never revealed the words: \"O true believers\" but, Ali was understood to be the Lord and the chief of them, and verily the Lord has reproved the companions of the Holy Prophet in various places but has never mentioned Ali save with approval.\"\n(iv) Al Tirmizi, Al Nisai and Ibn Maja from Habshi bin Junada say that the Holy Prophet said: \"All is a part of me and I of Ali.\"\n(v) Al Tabarani records in the Awsat from Jabir bin Abdullah that the Holy Prophet said: \"The people are of various stocks but I and Ali are of one stock.\"\n(vi) Al Tabarani records in the Aswat and Saghir from Ummi Salima that she narrates: \"I heard the Holy Prophet say: \"Ali with the Quran and the Quran with Ali shall not be separated until they arrive at the fountain of Kawthar in paradise.\"\n(vii) Ibn Sad records on the authority of Ali that he said: \"By Allah a verse of the Quran was never revealed but I know regarding what it was revealed and where it was revealed, for my Lord has given unto me a wise heart and an eloquent tongue.\"\n(viii) Ibn Sad and others on the authority of Abu Tufayl record that Ali said: \"Ask me regarding the book of Allah, for verily there is not a verse but I know whether it was revealed by night or by day, in the plains or on the mountains.\"\n(ix) Al Tirmizi and Al Hakim record from Ali that the Holy Prophet said: \"I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate.\"\n(x) Ibn Masud says that the Holy Prophet said: \"To look at Ali is devotion.\"\n(xi) Muslim records on the authority of Ali that he said: \"By Him who had cleft the seed and created the soul, verily the Holy Prophet stated to me that none but a true believer would love me, and none but a hypocrite would hate me.\"\n(xii) Al Tirmizi from Abu Sa-id al-Khudri says that he said: \"We used to distinguish the hypocrites by their hatred of Ali.\"\n(xiii) Ibn Asakir on the authority of Abu Bakr records that the Holy Prophet said: \"Looking at Ali is worship.\"\n(xiv) Al Tabarani from Ummi Salima says that the Holy Prophet said: \"He who has loved Ali has verily loved me, and he who has hated Ali has verily hated me, and he who has hated me, verily hated the Lord.\"\n(xv) Abu Yula and Al-Bazzaz from Sad bin Abi Waqqas say that the Holy Prophet said: \"He who annoys Ali, has annoyed me.\"\n(xvi) Ahmed bin Hanbal records and Al-Hakim, on the authority of Umme Salima verifies that she narrates: \"I heard the Holy Prophet say: \"He who has reviled Ali verily he has reviled me.\"\n(xvii) Sad bin Al-Musyib says that Umar bin Khattab used to pray to Allah to preserve him from a perplexing case which the father of Hasan (Ali), was not present to decide and that Umar said: \"None of the companions used to say 'Ask me' except Ali.\"\n(xviii) Al Tabarani says in the Awsat from Ibn Abbas that he said: \"Ali possessed eighteen eminent qualities which belonged to no other of the people.\"\n(xix) Al Bazzaz records on the authoritv of Sad that the Holy Prophet said to Ali: \"It is not lawful for anyone to be in the Masjid while under the obligation of performing a total ablution, except for me and for you.\"\n(xx) Abu Yula says that Umar bin Khattab said: \"Verily Ali had been endowed with three qualities of which had I but one it would be more precious to me than were I given high bred camels.\" It was asked of him what they were, he replied: \"His remaining in the masjid while that is permitted to him which is not lawful for me, his carrying the standard on the day of Khaybar and his wedding the Holy Prophet's daughter.\"\n(xxi) The two Shaykhs (Bukhari and Muslim) record on the authority of Sad ibne Al-Waqqas that the Holy Prophet left Ali ibn Abi Talib behind as his vicegerent during the expedition to Tabuk, and Ali said: \"O Messenger of Allah, do you leave me behind among the women and children?\" He replied: \"Are you not content to be to me in the relation of Harun to Musa save that there shall be no prophet after me?\"\n(xxii) And from Sahl ibn Sad said that the Holy Prophet said on the day of Khaybar: \"I will surely give the standard tomorrow to one at whose hands the Lord will give victory, one who loves Allah and His Prophet and whom Allah and His Prophet love.\" The people passed the night in perplexity as to whom it would be given. When they entered upon the dawn, they went early to the Holy Prophet, each one of them hoping that it would be given to him, but he said: \"Where is Ali the son of Abu Talib?\" They said to him: \"He complains of pain in his eyes.\" He said: \"Then send for him.\" They brought him and the Holy Prophet applied his saliva in his eyes and prayed for him, and he was healed so that it was as if he had no pain, and he gave him the standard.\n(xxiii) Muslim records on the authority of Sad ibn Abi Waqqas that when verse 61 of Ali Imran was reveled, the Holy Prophet summoned Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn and said: \"O Allah, these are my Ahl ul Bayt.\"\n(xxiv) Al Tabarani records in the Awsat and Abu Nu-aym in the Dala-il, on the authority of Zadan, that Ali was relating a tradition when a man accused him of speaking falsely, and Ali said to him: \"Shall I curse-\"and Ali cursed him, and he did not quit the place till his sight left him.\n(xxv) Abul Qasim-al-Zajajaji narrates in his dictations that Ali composed a work on the principles of the Arabic language, and the grammar of the Arabic language.\nAs has been stated at several places that praiseworthy qualities are described in the Quran in general terms but they were manifested in full perfection by the Ahl ul Bayt, as recorded in authentic books of history and commentary written by well known Muslim scholars. These qualities are, no doubt, also found in other true believers according to their degree of submission to the will of Allah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThis verse lays down the basis by which a true believer is distinguished from a hypocrite.\nThe prophets and the imams are always helped by a spiritual power from Allah which may be described as ruhul qudus (holy spirit), and the true believing followers are helped by the spirit of faith\n(ruhul iman).

Then, because of their treason and projected murder of the Holy Prophet, they were asked to leave the strategic position which they occupied, about 3 miles south of Madina, endangering the very existence of the Muslims. At first they disagreed, relying on their fortresses and their secret alliances with the pagans of Makka and the hypocrites among the Muslims. When the Muslims marched against the Bani Nadir and besieged them while they were in their strong towers, the hypocrites did nothing; and when at length they were exiled, the hypocrites did not go with them into exile. Some went to Syria and some joined their brethren in Khaybar. The Bani Nadir deserved punishment for treason and projected murder of the Holy Prophet, but their lives were spared, and they were allowed to carry away their goods and chattels.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 59:4]\nVerse 4 was revealed to announce punishment of the fire in the hereafter for those who opposed the Holy Prophet in his lifetime or after his departure from this world. The application is not restricted to the Jews of Bani Nadir, but as a general principle it is applicable in all ages. Therefore those who became Muslims but continued to disobey and oppose the Holy Prophet in order to corrupt and distort the religion of Allah should be dealt with in the light of this verse.\nThe early history of Islam records the behaviour of the companions which brings to light the following events;\n(i) When the companions, present beside his bed on the eve of his departure from this world, refused to give him pen and paper for writing that which would keep them on the right path and prevent them from backsliding into error, he commanded them to leave his presence at once. See commentary of Nisa: 65 for hadith al qirtas. Umar bin Khattab said: \"The man wanders in delirium. The book of Allah is sufficient for us.\" A large body of Muslims take this announcement of Umar as a move of separation from the religion established by the Holy Prophet, who directed all to follow the Quran and his Ahl ul Bayt (see hadith al thaqalayn on page 6). Some said that the writing material should be given; others sided with Umar. Voices rose high. The Holy Prophet recited verse 2 of Hujurat and said: \"Begone, let me alone. The women (who wanted to provide pen and paper but rebuked by Umar) are much better than you.\"\nHadith al qirtas has been reported by Bukhari, Muslim, Tabarani, Ahmed bin Hanbal and Shahrastani.\nWhile the Holy Prophet lay dead in the apartment, the ansar assembled at Saqifa Bani Sa-ada to choose Sad bin Obada as their leader. Receiving the news, Abu Bakr, Abu Obayda and Umar with their supporters hurried to Saqifa. As they used to run away from the battlefield in the face of danger, they now deserted him in the lure of temporal power. All, unconcerned of the movement outside, performed the prescribed funeral rites with the Holy Prophet's uncle Abbas, his two sons Qutham and Fadal, Usama and Salih. Refer to Ibn Sad in Tabaqat; Tairkh al Khamis; Tarikh Abul Fida.\n(iii) The drama staged at Saqifa Bani Sa-ada was a clear violation, transgression and deviation in view of the covenant they made with the Holy Prophet at Ghadir Khum.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 59:6]\nAs has been asserted in several verses of the Quran whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and between them belongs to Allah. They are made available to people as a trust. When disbelieving possessors turn hostile and aggressive against Allah and His Prophet, then, if their possessions are returned to the prophet of Allah without any effort or exertion on the part of the believers, such possessions become the property of His prophet. In this way it is distinguished from anfal (spoils), taken after fighting. Even in the case of anfal the authority of the prophet of Allah is unchallengeable. See commentary of Anfal: 1.\nThe voluntary submission of the enemy in verse 2 has been referred to here.\nThe Jews of Madina had come from outside and seized the lands of the original inhabitants. Since then they had been scheming and plotting to retain the usurped properties by hook or by crook. Seeing the growth of Islam they became more active and aggressive against the people of Madina. It was a just and wise decree of the Lord of the worlds to restore the lands to their original owners and thus bring peace and order in the region.\nFa-i is derived from afa which means \"returned to\". The warriors are not entitled to any share in the property of fa-i as stated above. It belongs to Allah and His Prophet and is to be distributed among the relatives of the Holy Prophet (see commentary of Anfal: 41; Nahl: 90; Rum: 38), orphans, the needy and the wayfarer, so that it does not concentrate in the hands of a few rich-this serves as a basis for the socio-economic system of Islam.\nAfter the Holy Prophet his share has to be given to the Imam of his Ahl ul Bayt in addition to the share of his relatives. To know the real and genuine relatives (Ahl ul Bayt) of the Holy Prophet see commentary of Baqarah: 124; Ali Imran: 61; Ahzab: 33 and Shura: 23.\nAlso see commentary of Bani Isarail: 26; Naml: 15, 16; Nahl: 90 and Maryam: 2 to 15 for the unjust, unislamic and unquranic deviation of the so-called followers of the Holy Prophet resorted to for depriving the Ahl ul Bayt from their rightful share decreed by Allah. They began to misappropriate the share of the Holy Prophet in the name of \"baytul mal\" (public treasury), which is an open transgression of the explicit ordinance of Allah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 59:9]\nThis verse refers to the ansar (the helpers), the people of Madina, who accepted Islam when it was opposed tooth and nail by the pagans of Makka, and who invited the Holy Prophet to settle down in Madina and become their leader. The ties of brotherhood were established between mahajirin and ansar. When the confiscated land and property of Bani Nadir was divided, and the major portion was given to the mahajirin, there was not the least jealousy on the part of the ansar, although there were poor among them also. They rejoiced in the good fortune of their brothers. We give below a few events pertaining to the generosity of Imam Ali mentioned in Minhajul Sadiqin.\n(i) Once, having come to know that there was no food in the house, Ali borrowed a dinar and went to the market to buy some cereals. There he found Miqdad crossing a street. He was strolling to fritter away time as in his house also there was no food. He could not bear the sorry plight of his children. The Imam found out the real cause of his distressed appearance and gave him the dinar and resumed to home with empty hands.\n(ii) Abdullah bin Masud reports that once, after the isha salat, a man from among the prayers stood up and said: \"I am very poor. I am hungry.\" The Holy Prophet said: \"Who among you will give food to this man?\" Ali stood up and took the poor man to his home. There was food in the house, but barely enough for one man which was kept for him. Ali put out the lamp and gave it to Fatimah asking her to bring it back when the guest had eaten the food. It was done so that the guest might not feel discomforted and uneasy. Ali sat with him and acted as if he too was eating.\nThe house of Ahl ul Bayt always put their trust wholly in Allah under all circumstances and gave whatever they had in the way of Allah.\nOnce a group of men came to Ali and said: \"We always rely upon Allah. We eat when we have food, and if we do not have it we bear with patience.\" Ali said: \"Real dependence on Allah is to thank Him when there is nothing with you, and when you have anything to give it to others who are more in need of it than you.\"\nShuhha is not niggardliness. Niggardliness is not giving from that which is in hand. Shuhha is covetousness-desire to deprive others of what they have and own everything for personal use.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"To acquire forbidden possessions is shuhha. Never resort to it because shuhha and faith (in Allah) never exist together in the heart of a true believer. There is nothing more destitute than a masjid where the people living around it do not come to pray; or the book of Allah (Quran) in a house dwellers of which never recite; or a scholar among the careless people none of whom goes to him to learn from his wisdom; or a helpless believer in the captivity of disbelievers.\"\n"

To harbour ill will and grudge against any true believer is infidelity.\n"

They were punished and banished for their treachery about a month after the battle of Badr, long before the banishment of Bani Nadir upon whom that lesson was lost.\n"

The sinner is left alone to bear the consequences of rebellion and transgression.\nIt is said that on the eve of the departure for the battle of Badr, Shaytan in the guise of the chief of Bani Kananah assured Abu Jahl that he would certainly prevail over the Holy Prophet but when he saw the angels descending from heaven ran away from the scene of the battle, forsaking Abu Jahl and his comrades to defeat and disgrace.

He is the real owner of all excellences.\nImam Ali said:\nTotal dedication to Allah is correspondingly related to mature understanding of His Supreme Being.\n(He is) the (absolute) being, not 'happened for the first time', nor His being is on account of an accident or event; the (ever) existing, not after \"missing\" or \"be wanting\", nor there is any \"before\" before Him.\nHe is along with everything, not allied, related or circumstanced;\naloof, by Himself, (but) not detached, nor missing or slipping over any thing;\nmaking, doing, operating, effective, not in terms of movement or motion, nor through any medium; seeing, even when there was 'nothing' to look at.\nUtmost degree of involvement (with Him) tells the truth that \"He is single\". Ultimate of \"He is single\" belief generates sincere love with Him. The most possible in sincere love is not to associate qualifying terms with Him, because every adjective demonstrate its exclusion from the substance, and every substance certifies that it is other than the adjective.\nThere is no adjective, limiting definition of His attributes, at hand to give a character to the actual and make it agree with the same; and incomputable is the space of time (to record His beginning), and no \"time to come\" will arrest the end, therefore, whoso gives Allah a character joins one thing to another; and he who joins together, adds (addition in effect is collection of bit and pieces); and to divide Him into parts and portions is to be unwittingly ignorant of Him; and to stipulate direction or position is to circumscribe Him. He who outlines Him in fact computes Him. \"In\" infers He is that which is implied; \"upon, at or by\" assumes void devoid of Him. He was \"there\" before the created beings could describe Him.\nHe who describes Him in terms of qualities, gives simile or example, or estimates relatively, in fact, does not subscribe to His singleness. He, who draws a parallel or brings to mind a likeness to convey an image of Him, has not indeed referred to Him. He who makes a conjecture and employs guesswork goes wrong and does not have in him to know Allah as the independent, everlasting and free of wants Lord master.\n(Selected sentences taken from various sermons of the Nahj al Balagha).\n "

Jibrail revealed the affair to the Holy Prophet who immediately sent Ali, Miqdad and Ammar after her. The spy, when intercepted, readily presented herself for a search, denying the charge she was accused of. Having full faith in the knowledge of the Holy Prophet, Ali threatened her with slaughter if she did not produce the letter. Then she brought the letter from the long tresses of her hair. On being questioned, Hatib offered the excuse that it was solely due to his natural desire to save his unprotected family at the hands of the Makkan pagans. The Holy Prophet, in view of his past conduct, graciously asked him to seek pardon from Allah.\nThis was shortly before the conquest of Makka, but the principle is of universal importance. There cannot be any intimacy with the enemies of your faith and people, who are persecuting your faith and seeking to destroy you and your faith.

In order to give no room of complaint to the pagans, the dower they had given on marriage should be repaid to the husband.\nIslam recognises the change of faith as one of the causes of separation.\nThe believers are told to examine women who come to them as fugitives from the idolaters and find out their real and inner motives that they are prompted by the sole desire of serving Islam and of saving their faith, and are not pretenders. The examination should be directed, among other things, to the points mentioned in verse 12. They were required\n(i) not to worship any god save one true God, Allah;\n(u) not to steal;\n(iii) not to indulge in sex outside the marriage tie;\n(iv) not to commit infanticide,\n(v) not to disobey the laws and principles of Islam.\nMa arjulihanna literally means \"not to utter slander which they have forged between their hands and feet\", which implies the practice of ascribing their spurious (illegitimate) children to their husbands.\nLa yaqtulna awladahunna (not to kill their children) also refers to abortion.\n"

He command his disciples to address their appeal only to \"the lost sheep of the house of Israil.\"\nRefer to the commentary of Baqarah: 40.\nThe teaching of Isa was singularly restricted to the children of Israil and therefore necessitated the advent of another teacher which is admitted by the Christians themselves. It is written in Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics:\n\"His ethical teaching was so suggestive but so paradoxical, so figurative, and incomplete. It was designed not to save us from the trouble of thinking but to turn our thoughts to the comforter whom he promised to send\" (Vol. xii p.621).\n\"Ahmad\" was employed as a translation of \"the periclytos\" in old Arabic versions of the New Testament. Muir and Sale say that Ahmad or Muhammad, the praised one, is almost a translation of the Greek word periclytos. In the present gospel of John 14: 16; 15: 26 and 16: 7, the word \"comforter\" blithe English version is for the Greek word \"Paracletos\", which means \"advocate\", \"one called to the help of another, a kind friend\", rather than \"comforter\". Paracletos is a corrupt reading for Periclytos, and in the original saying of Isa there was a prophecy of the Holy Prophet Ahmad by name. Even if it is read Paraclete, it would apply to the Holy Prophet.\nSee \"The Injil\" on page 375. The present version of the Injil known as the New Testament is neither complete nor reliable.\nIsa said:\n\"I was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" (Matthew 15: 24).\n\"Do not take the road to gentile lands, and do not enter any Samaritan town; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" (Matthew 10: 5 and 6).\nThe mission of Isa was for the lost sheep of Israel.\nThe following verses of the Bible contain the prophecy of the advent of the Holy Prophet, who came with an universal message as a mercy for all creatures, in all times, till the end of the world.\nIsa said:\n\"I will ask the Father, and He will give you another to be your advocate, who will be with you for ever-the spirit of truth.\" (John: 14: 16).\n\"However, when he comes who is the spirit of truth, he will guide into all the truth, he will not speak on his own authority, but will tell only what he hears; and he will make known to you the things that are coming.\" (John 16: 13).\nVerse 81 of Bani Israil and 49 of Saba say that when \"the perfect\" comes all \"the imperfect\" vanish and are lost to oblivion.\nWhat has been mentioned in Deuteronomy 18: 15, 18 and 19 has been referred to in verses 3 and 4 of Najm.\nJohn the Baptist (Yahya) says in John 1: 19 to 21 that he was neither the Messiah (Isa), nor Elijah (Ilyas) nor the \"awaited\" prophet. It clearly shows that the prophet referred to in Deuteronomy 18: 18 was neither Isa nor John the Baptist (Yahya).\n\"Then the Lord said to me (Musa): 'I will raise up for them a prophet like you, one of their own race, and I will put my words into his mouth. He shall convey all my commands to them.'\" (Deuteronomy 18: 18)\nThe Prophet referred to in Deuteronomy 18: 15, 18 and 19 is like Musa. Isa was not like Musa. Isa was born without a father, a miracle, unlike Musa who had a father and a mother; and Musa was a law-giver whereas Isa was sent to follow and fulfil the law of Musa.\nIsa said:\n\"Do not suppose that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to complete.\"\nThe comforter or the spirit of truth (Ahmad or Muhammad) would praise him (Isa), according to John 16: 14, and make known the truth about Isa and Maryam, teach mankind all the truth about all things; and his teachings would remain in force for all times, whereas Isa's mission (Matthew 15: 24 and 10: 5 to 6) was restricted to the children of Israel only.\nAccording to Araf: 158; Anbiya: 107 and Saba: 28 the Holy Prophet was sent to guide the whole mankind.\nAs stated in John 14: 26: \"Your comforter, the Holy Ghost (or spirit), whom the father will send in my name, will teach you everything\", the Holy Prophet was not an ordinary human being but holy, thoroughly purified by Allah as per Ahzab: 33, which refers to him and his Ahl ul Bayt.\n"

Good done on Friday earns many rewards, while invocations made are accepted.\"\nFriday is also known as:\n(i) Yawm al Mawlud-The birthday of the Holy Prophet. Imam Mahdi al Qa-im was also born on Friday.\n(ii) Yawm al Fazl-The day of grace.\n(iii) Yawm al barkat-the day of blessings.\n(iv) Yawm al ijabat-the day of acceptance of invocations and prayers.\n(v) Yawm al id-The day of rejoicing.\n(vi) Yawm al ghuzwa-The day of endeavour.\n(vii) Yawm al Karamat-the day of honour.\n(viii) Yawm al mazid-the day of abundance.\nWhile migrating from Makka to Madina, the Holy Prophet made a halt at Quba, a place 3 miles away from Madina. On Friday he proceeded to Madina. When he entered the valley of Bani Salim bin Awf it was time for Friday prayers. A place was selected there as a temporary masjid, and after delivering a sermon he prayed Friday prayers.\nThe wise ordinances of Islam provide ample opportunities of social contact for the Muslims.\nEach individual remembers Allah five times every day in the home or place of business or local masjid. On Friday, in every week, there is a local meeting in the central masjid of each local centre; it may be a village, or town or ward of a big city. At the two ids every year there is a local area meeting in one centre, the idgah. Once at least in a lifetime, a Muslim, having sufficient means, joins the vast international assemblage of the world, in the centre of Islam, at Kabah. The primary purpose in all the obligatory and optional forms of worship is the remembrance of glorification of Allah, but they also create spirit of unity, brotherhood and collective understanding and provide opportunities for mutual consultation and action.\nThe idea behind the Muslim weekly \"day of assembly\" is different from that of the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday) or the Christian Sunday. The Jewish Sabbath is primarily a commemoration of God's ending his work and resting on the seventh day (Genesis 2: 2; Exodus 20: 11). According to the Quran Allah needs no rest, nor does He feel fatigue (Baqarah: 255). The Jewish command forbids work on the day of Sabbath but says nothing about worship or prayer; but the Islamic ordinance lays stress on the remembrance of Allah. The Christian church had changed the Saturday to Sunday but inherited the Jewish spirit.\nIslam says: \"When the time for Jumu-ah prayer comes, discontinue every activity and answer the call to prayer, meet earnestly, pray, consult and learn by social contact; and when the meeting is over, scatter and go about your business.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAlthough hastening to the remembrance of Allah has been ordained in this verse, but there is no mention of the form of prayer. It was the Holy Prophet, the divinely authorised authority on the Quran, who showed the people how to pray every type of salat. The details and the conditions of ibadat (worship), mamilat (all social and individual activities) and siyasiyat (collective living) are decided and finalised according to the sayings and doings of the Holy Prophet and his authorised successors, the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt, which is known as Islamic jurisprudence.\nThe right to call to congregational prayer, according to the Holy Prophet and the Imams of Ahl ul Bayt rests with the just or the divinely appointed head of the Islamic state and his appointed deputies.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 63:1]\nThe concealed malignancy of hypocrisy is more harmful than open hostility. It is a source of weakness and a danger to the very existence of the community.\nRefer to the commentary of Baqarah: 8 to 20; Ali Imran: 121 to 128, 140 to 159, 166 to 168; Nisa : 60 to 63, 65; Bara-at: 25 to 27, 61, 63, 64 to 66, 71, 73, 79, 80, 86, 87, 89, 92, 94; Mujadilah: 14 to 21 for the hypocrites. In several other verses also the identity of the hypocrites in the days of the Holy Prophet and after his departure from this world has been described in the light of history written by well known Muslim scholars.\nAs has been pointed out in the commentary of Bara-at: 25 to 27 and 38 to 59 and 80 to 90 and 120, there were hypocrites in hijra 9 according to the verses of the Quran, but almost all the historians, traditionists and commentators do not mention even one name after the departure of the Holy Prophet, although, step by step, they took total control of the Muslim society, and when they reigned supreme in the days of Mu-awiyah and Yazid their theoreticians began to distort and corrupt the true message of Allah. So it is rightly said that if Imam Husayn had not stood up and taken stand against the evil forces of hypocrisy by giving his life, property and children in the cause of Allah, the world would have been following the theories and practices of the hypocrites as the religion of Allah. Instead of clearly pointing out the hypocrites, following the example of the Quran, the Muslim scholars invented a paradox by stating that whosoever pronounced the kalimah by mouth, saw, heard and talked to the Holy Prophet was a sahabi (companion) worthy of highest respect and honour, although the Quran has clearly refuted this theory. In addition to several Quranic verses, the surah al Munafiqun is a manifest testimony that there were many sincere companions among the followers of the Holy Prophet, but a powerful, scheming and evil group of hypocrites was lurking in the background which seized power at the opportune time to sow the seed of imperialism, contrary to the teachings of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt, to fulfil their aim of destroying the true religion of Allah.\nWhile returning from the battle against the Jews of Bani Mustaliq in which their leader, Harith bin Abi Zarar, was killed; a servant of Umar clashed with one of the ansar and occasioned a quarrel between the ansar and the muhajirin. Abdullah bin Obay, siding with the ansar taunted the mahajirin as people who would, with their growing power, subjugate the ansar if necessary steps were not taken to check their belligerent behaviour. He also reproached the people of Madina for giving shelter and support to the Holy Prophet and the believers from Makka. To ridicule the Holy Prophet and his companions, he pointed out their poverty and declared them a burden on the people of Madina. Zayd bin Arqam reported his words to the Holy Prophet. Obaydullah, the son of Abdullah bin Obay, a staunch follower of the Holy Prophet, hearing all about this, came to the Holy Prophet and told him that if he had any thoughts of condemning his father to death, he would be the first man to obey his order. The Holy Prophet bade the young man not to think badly of his father and be kind to him.\nBefore reaching Madina the Holy Prophet had to break journey at Baqa because a violent wind began to blow. The Holy Prophet said that it was due to the death of a sincere servant of Allah, Rifa-a, in Madina. The hypocrites whispered among themselves that the Holy Prophet was bluffing; he could not know what had happened in Madina. In the meantime it was reported to him that his camel was missing. To show the hypocrites that the messenger of Allah knew what they could not, he asked them to go in the direction the wind was blowing and they would find his camel tied to a tree. They went and brought the camel back whom they found tied to a tree some distance away as told by the Holy Prophet; and when they entered Madina they saw the coffin of Rifa-a being taken to Baqi for burial.\nAfter a few days Abdullah bin Obay died. The hypocrites began to tease Zayd bin Arqam for reporting the blasphemies, Abdullah bin Obay uttered, to the Holy Prophet. Verse one clears the position of Zayd and believers like him and condemns the bogus faith of the hypocrites.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe testimony of the hypocrites, among the companions of the Holy Prophet, to his prophethood is stated in this verse as a fact, yet Allah bears witness that they are liars, because their verbal acclamation was not in accord with what was in their hearts. The history and the modus operandi of the hypocrites have been made clear by these verses.\nThe difference between nifaq and taqiyah is that nifaq shows belief outwardly and hides disbelief for worldly gains out of selfish motives, whereas taqiyah hides belief in the cause of Allah with godly motives.\nThe hypocrites take false oaths to screen their evil deeds (Mujadilah: 16) and to save their life and property.\nTheir double-dealing obscures their understanding which in fact is the seating of their hearts, a consequence of their persistence in disbelief and opposition to the true guidance. There is nothing in their hearts save falsehood. They are like hallow timber, which is useless, and has to be propped up against other things. They are like rotten timber. They have no firm character themselves, and for others they are unsafe props to rely upon (see Hashr: 2 and 3). Their conscience always troubles them. They are under constant apprehension of exposure. They are cowards of the meanest type when they are against the enemy in a battlefield. They are the worst enemies of the Holy Prophet and the religion of Allah. The stiff-necked rejecters of the truth create a wide gulf between themselves and the mercy of Allah.\nNo prayer for them will save them from the eternal punishment.\nIntercession by the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt and consequent divine forgiveness is available to those who make mistakes unintentionally or in ignorance or under duress or pressure but repent and make amends. In the total commitment to rebellion and transgression the hypocrites cannot obtain Allah's pardon.\nVerse 8 contains the words Abdullah bin Obey said in the course of the expedition against Banu Mustaliq mentioned above. He said:\n\"This you have brought upon yourselves, by inviting these strangers to come amongst us. Wait till we return to Madina; then the mightier shall surely expel the weaker.\"\nThose who had come with the Holy Prophet to Madina were received with open arms by the people of Madina. The hypocrites did not like this and tried in underhand ways to dissuade them from doing all they could for the mahajirin. Allah holds the keys of the treasures of man's well being. He does not leave His servants at the mercy of His enemies. The small community of believers grew from strength to strength until they were able to rely on the resources given to them by Allah and augment the well being of their hosts as well.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIt is a warning to those who try to strangle a right cause by putting economic pressure on the followers of the truth.\n"

On the other hand those believers who are considered meek and described as have-nots in this world will acquire honour, dignity and eternal happiness. See commentary of Furqan: 70. Allah will blot out their faults, mistakes and shortcomings and remove their sorrows, sufferings and disappointments. When a sinner turns repentant to Allah and resolves to amend and do good and does so, his past is forgiven and he is transferred from the abyss of degradation to the height of honour.\nThe word taghabun is derived from ghaban which means overcoming in selling or buying. Here it is used to compare the worth of gains the righteous will obtain and the loss the evildoers will suffer. It is said that every believer will enter paradise after he sees the place he would have been allotted in hell if he had not believed and done good deeds; and every disbeliever will see the place in paradise he would have been given if he had believed and done good deeds before going to hell.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nEvery man is judged in view of his deeds concerning his self as soon as he dies, receiving rewards for good deeds or punishment for evil deeds; but for his deeds affecting social and collective life the final and abiding judgement will be made after the resurrection. He who has been commanded for his individual shortcomings may be forgiven on the day of judgement in the light of his obedience to divine laws in his social and collective life. Since the abiding loss or gain the day of judgement is described as the day of mutual loss or gain-yawmut taghabun.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 65:1]\nIn the first instance the Holy Prophet is addressed individually, as the teacher, leader, guide and vicegerent of Allah. Then the actual directions are addressed to the community collectively.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Of all things permitted by law, divorce is the most hateful in the sight of Allah.\"\nWhile the sanctity of marriage is the essential basis of family life, the incompatibility of individuals and the weaknesses of human nature require certain adjustments and safeguards if that sanctity is not to be made an obsession at the expense of congeniality of human life.\nStudy the general directions and limitations of divorce in the commentary of Baqarah: 227 to 237 and 241; Nisa: 35 and Ahzab: 49. Iddat, a prescribed period to be observed after the divorce, is a technical term in divorce law, and has been explained in the abovenoted verses. Iddat is in the interest of the wife, the husband, the unborn child (if there is any) and sexual relationship, therefore is essential to maintain a civilised, balanced and orderly human society.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIt is commanded to divorce a woman at a time when she is not in the period of menstruation while no cohabitation had taken place.\nAbdullah bin Umar made a mistake in divorcing his wife. Bukhari and Muslim narrate that he divorced his wife when she was in menstruation. Knowing this the Holy Prophet asked Abdullah to withdraw his divorce and keep her as a wife till she was free from the monthly course, then wait for her next menstruation and when she became clear again he could divorce her without cohabitation.\nThe concluding words give the reason for the iddat. It also makes it clear that three pronouncements of divorce in a single space of time is illegal. This portion says that a reconciliation is possible, and is recommended, at any stage, which is not possible if three announcements as above are made.\nFor the teachings of the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt see commentary of Baqarah: 231.\nIf desire and commitment \"to safeguard against evil with full awareness of divine laws\" exists, Allah often provides a solution in the most unexpected ways: worst enemies reach compromise and reconciliation, seemingly separated hearts are united and apparently irreparable injuries are healed.\n\"Perchance Allah may bring about some new situation\" in verse 1 and \"Allah will make a way out for him\" in verse 2 verify the Shi-ah point of view that there should be intervals in the 3 pronouncements of talaq, so as to give opportunity to husband and wife for reconciliation.\nIf \"WA MAN YATTAQILLAHA YAJ-AL LAHU MAKHRAJA\" in verse 2 and the whole verse 3 is recited 100 times after praying a 2 rak-at salat after midnight before daybreak in 40 consecutive nights, the promise of \"a new situation\" and \"a way out\" will be fulfilled.\nSee commentary of Baqarah: 231 and Nisa: 35 for the rights of the wife and the husband.\nIt is said that when verse 3 was revealed some simple-minded companions stopped making efforts to earn their livelihood, sat in their homes and recited this verse. Dependence upon Allah means not to rely upon people, events and sources for the fruits of labour but have full faith in Allah that He alone will return the recompense of labour, intelligence, learning and application man puts in his efforts to earn his sustenance, proportionate to that which has been invested. Allah's universal plan is always good and just. His ordering of the universe observes a due, just and perfect proportion.\nHe who depends on Allah (i) give thanks to Allah when he receives His bounties, (ii) never complains, nor turns to others, but bears with patience if he finds himself in distress and in want of earthly goods, (iii), gives what he is given by Allah to those who are in need and come to him for help.\nFor the waiting period (iddat) prescribed for women who have normal monthly course, or irregular monthly course, or carry life in their wombs refer to fiqh.\nAllah's commands are not arbitrary. They help us, lead us to our good, temporal and spiritual. If we obey His commands, His wisdom and guidance solve our difficulties, remove the stink of immorality and ungodliness from our hearts and create in us discipline and order.\nThose who disobey Allah's commands, and transgress the limits prescribed by Him, suffer humiliation and loss in this life and earn eternal punishment in the hereafter. Call to mind the fate of the people of Nuh, Salih, Lut, Shu-ayb and Firawn in the days of Musa, narrated in Araf, Hud, Yunus and other surahs and take warning. Laws relating to our fellow-beings in society, to our families and children in matters such as explained in the verses referred to above and in this surah are as important as any in our spiritual life. Those who take these laws light perish in this world and will suffer sure punishment in the hereafter.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 66:1]\nAs a preface to this surah refer to and study carefully the commentary of Ahzab : 28 to 32, 33, 34, 35 on pages 897 to 908 in which the character pattern of the two wives referred to in this surah, A-isha and Hafsa, has been discussed in the light of the traditions reported by Bukhari and other well known Muslim scholars.\nThe Holy Prophet used to drink a glass of honey-syrup whenever he visited the apartment of Zaynab. A-isha and Hafsa became resentful, and A-isha devised a plot. Knowing the Holy Prophet's dislike of unpleasant smells she held her nose when he came to her apartment after drinking a glass of honey-syrup prepared by Zaynab, and accused him of having eaten the produce of a very ill-smelling tree. When she accused him of having eaten maghafir (a nauseating herb) the Holy Prophet said that he had taken only honey. She said: \"The bees had fed on maghafir.\" When he visited Hafsa she also acted just like A-isha. Displeased with their obnoxious behaviour the Holy Prophet vowed not to eat honey any more. This is recorded by Bukhari in his commentary on Tahrim, in his Sahih, Vol. 3, p. 136. In the same place are recorded several traditions as related by Umar bin Khattab stating that the two women, A-isha and Hafsa were insolent and haughty towards the Holy Prophet.\nOn a day assigned to Hafsa, when she was not found in her apartment as she went to her parent's house, the Holy Prophet spent the night with Marya, the coptic girl, presented to him by the ruler of Egypt, who became the mother of his son, Ibrahim. To calm the quarrelsome bad temper of Hafsa he vowed that he would have no more to do with Marya.\nThe wives of the Holy Prophet were expected to show a higher standard in behaviour, as they were in the company of the superior most teacher of manners, social behaviour and etiquette.\nThe Holy Prophet's mind was sorely distressed by the obnoxious behaviour of A-isha and Hafsa and he renounced the society of his wives for one month. Verse one was revealed to say that as Allah has allowed him honey and Marya, he did not have to forsake any of them.\nIf any vow prevents from doing good or acting rightly one should expiate the vow, but not refrain from doing good deeds. For the expiation of oaths and vows see commentary of Ma-idah: 89 and for the vain oaths and vows Baqarah: 225.\nVerses 3 to 5 refer to A-isha and Hafsa who were envious and jealous to the point of sickness against the Holy Prophet's refined and highminded wives. Once Hafsa came to know about a very personal matter concerning the Holy Prophet which he thought should not be made public, therefore he asked her not to publish it. But she at once rushed to her friend A-isha and whispered to her a version which was in great part untrue. Hafsa who betrayed confidence and A-isha who encouraged the betrayal were commanded to turn in repentance to Allah. If they were to resist repentance and amends, they would be abetting each other's crime but could not harm the most perfect messenger of Allah whom all the spiritual forces always surrounded to protect from every type of slander and falsehood. Please refer to Kanz al Ummal, vol. 6 p. 294 and Ibn Sad's Tabaqat, vol.8, p. 115.\nSalihul muminin, \"the (most) righteous among the believers\" refers to Imam Ali according to Tafsir Durr al Manthur by Jalal al Din al Suyuti, Tafsir al Husayni, Kamaluddin Husayn Kashifi and Hayat ul Awliya.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nTo make a vow to do a thing which one has the option to do or not to do is permissible in Islam if there is good in it.\nA husband can accommodate his wife's legitimate desires to a reasonable extent. Ma-idah: 89 gives details of expiation for cancelling the oath.\nThe recommendation in verse 2 to the Holy Prophet to dissolve his oath is put forward in view of the insolent behaviour of A-isha and Hafsa described in verse 3. The tone of the first two verses is like Bara-at: 43 wherein hypocrites have been blamed for falsehood.\nRefer to the commentary of the verses of Ahzab mentioned above on pages 897 to 907 particularly Aqa Mahdi Puya's note on page 899. The Prophet had discretionary power to divorce any or all his wives, and if he did so Allah would give him good women as his wives in place of the existing wives, who were, in view of verse 5, ordinary women harbouring envy, jealousy, and ill-will against others; particularly A-isha's hostility towards Ali Ibn abi Talib has been recorded by all the well known historians. See commentary of Ahzab on pages 897 to 907. At last she led an army of insurgents against him in the battle of Jamal. See details of this battle in the Early History of Islam by Dr. Safdar Husain. At that time there were better women of character and integrity than the wives of the Holy Prophet. The evil demonstrated by the two has been described as sufficient transgression to be condemned to the fire of hell; so the believing and obedient wives of the Holy Prophet are warned to save themselves from a fire whose fuel is men and stones as stated in Baqarah: 24.\nWhen verse 6 was recited by the Holy Prophet a man stood up and said: \"I try my best to make the members of my family follow the commands of Allah, do good and avoid evil, but my advice falls on deaf ears and they-do not obey.\"\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Blessed is he who teaches righteousness and the commands of Allah to his family. If they do not listen to you, they shall be the fuel of the fire. You are safe because you have done your duty.\"\nIt is written in Minhajus Sadiqin that when those who have done good deeds and believed in Allah will be rewarded on the day of judgement, they will pray to Allah to bless him more and give him more reward who taught them the true teachings of Allah, His Prophet and Ahl ul Bayt and showed them how to follow them in letter and spirit. Reverse will be the fate of those heads of the families who did not do their duty to their families. All of them will be the fuel of the fire.\nThe punishment the disbelievers will undergo is the result of their disbelief and evil deeds. It is the fruit of their own misdeeds, the result of their own deliberate choice.\n"

Sincere repentance implies giving up and discontinuing of evil in thought and action with a firm determination not to repeat it ever again. If it is done then Allah will wipe off his past sins and admit him to the eternal land of bliss and happiness.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"A sincere repentant never sins again as the milk drawn from the breast never can go back to its source.\"\nImam Ali said:\n\"A sincere repentant (i) is ashamed of his past sins, (ii) takes up the duties overlooked and fulfils them, (iii) makes good the wilfully ignored conditions of a trust managed by him, (iv) forgives those who provoke him, (v) does not demand repayment of loans from those who are in financial distress, (vi) makes firm determination not to sin ever again, (vii) surrenders his self to the adoration, devotion and service of Allah when it had swelled to the point of exploding due to inordinate consumption of worldly pleasures, transgression and disobedience.\"\nFor \"those who believe with him\" refer to the commentary of Fat-h: 29.\nIn the light of Ahzab: 33, the Ahl ul Bayt alone are like the Holy Prophet in purity, wisdom and character because of which he took them with him in mubahilah (Ali Imran: 61), and because of which their love has been made obligatory on all Muslims in verse 23 of Shura, and they have been included in salawat or durud in verse 56 of Ahazab. Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 2 to 5 (page 51) for what the Holy Prophet said about Fatimah Zahra.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"Ali and I are from one and the same light.\"\n\"The children of Fatimah and Ali are my children.\"\n\"Husayn is from me and I am from Husayn.\"\nNot only Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn but all the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt are referred to as \"ibn rasulallah\" (son of the messenger of Allah) by all the Muslim historians and scholars, no matter which school of thought they belong to.\nRefer to Sahih Bukhari, Kitab al Maghazi, vol. 3, page 41 for the saying of the Holy Prophet: \"O Ali, you are from me and I am from you.\"\nAlso refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 124.\nAs stated in Sad: 75 the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt belong to the class of alin (the most exalted).

There were people whose behaviour has been described in the commentary of several verses pertaining to battles of Uhad, Khandaq and Hunayn, and at the time of the treaty of Hudaybiya and at the time of the departure of the Holy Prophet (hadith al qirtas), can at most reach the level of pardoned sinners.\nFor \"their light will run before them\" refer to the commentary of Hadid: 12; Nur: 33 to 37.\n"

This prove that death is not cessation of existence. Baqarah: 28 says: \"When you were dead He gave you life. Again He will cause you to die and again bring you to life.\" In Najm: 44 also death is put before life.\nDeath is not cessation of existence but a change of direction or transforming into another form. The state before our present life, or the state after, is not known to us or unknowable to us, but our present life is given to us as a trial to either do good and move to a nobler state of existence or follow the evil delusions and go to a place where existence is eternal damnation.\nTrial implies freedom of action and free will given to man, otherwise, if the theory of determinism is accepted, it would mean Allah does not know who will do what. Allah has given man intelligence, power of observation and contemplation and discretion to decide which path he will walk on. The idea of death reminds him about the life he will have after he crosses the frontiers of this life and enters a new state of existence. As he sows shall he reap. The consequences of his deeds in this life he shall face at once as soon as he leaves this world, and will continue to exist amid them, a state of existence known as barzakh as per Muminun: 100, till the day of judgement.\nIntercession or forgiveness is not possible during this period. On the day of judgement intercession will be available and Allah shall forgive and grant pardon to those who will be recommended by the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt.

See commentary of Baqarah: 1.\nAccording to some commentators it would be an appropriate link with pen, mentioned in this verse, if nun is taken as ink or ink-holder. They imply knowledge and learning. The wisdom of countless men from the beginning of civilisation is available today and will be there in every age in future in the form of written words. It is a continuous source of knowledge importance of which might have been referred to here.\nSome commentators say that the pen and the writing refer to the source of knowledge revealed through revelation to the Holy Prophet who only spoke words, revealed to him, full of meaning which unfolds itself in innumerable aspects to countless generations in all ages. The Holy Prophet was the living grace and mercy of Allah and he was exalted above abuse and persecution of ignorant men like the heathens of Makka.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nNun, according to some traditions from the Ahl ul Bayt and Ibn Abbas, is ink or ink-holder because of the mention of pen. However neither the pen nor the ink, mentioned in this verse, refers to the tools of writing used by man. They refer to the recording of events taking place in this world by the angelical agencies. By inference it lays great emphasis on learning and knowledge.\nThe Holy Prophet, as said by Imam Ali, ever since his birth received guidance, wisdom and inspiration from Allah to condition and regulate all aspects of his life.\n"

It was a reward not like an earthly reward that is used up or depleted, but one that was interwoven as part and parcel of the very core of his being which enabled him to do that which was right and proper in any circumstances.\nHe stands on a most exalted standard of character and his life is an incomparable living illustration and explanation of the Quran. It is more appropriate if said that the Quran is a mirror of his most honoured being. His life pattern is now the standard for his followers.\nThe life account of the \"mercy unto the worlds\" cannot be reported in few pages. In the light of the recorded events of his life, even the worst enemies of Islam, accept the fact that no man better than him ever lived on the earth.\nRefer to the commentary of Baqarah: 190 to 193 to the answer to the criticism; based upon prejudice and conjecture, by the enemies of Islam. The sublime moral and spiritual excellences of the Holy Prophet manifested in every aspect of his private as well as public life. He lived among the people without making known his ministry for forty years in order to first establish his truthfulness, reliability, kindness, highmindedness, tolerance and wisdom, so that when the announcement of his prophethood would be made, they should have no hesitation in accepting the invitation given by him to worship one God, but those who called him al amin and al sadiq vehemently opposed his mission. Al amin bears a comprehensive range of meanings. Al in the Arabic language denotes exclusive distinction and refers to the person who alone owns the quality mentioned after it. Amin refers to a person who can be trusted beyond any suspicion in whatever he does or undertakes to do. So it was a divine plan to bind the people with their own judgement. The Quran is the only scripture which asserts that its teacher is the perfect model or ideal for the whole mankind, therefore the people must believe in the message he has conveyed to them. See commentary of Ahzab: 21 and 22. Since he was the last prophet, perfection in every aspect of life, material as well as spiritual, was illustrated in him. Refer to the commentary of Ali Imran : 81, Baqarah: 253 and 285, and Bani Israil: 1, to know about the superiority of the Holy Prophet over all other prophets of Allah. See commentary of Baqarah: 2 and Ya Sin: 12 to know that the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt are the reflection of the Quran or the Quran is the reflection of their lives. Refer to the hadith al thaqalayn on page 6. Also refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 143; Nisa: 41; Ahzab: 45 and 46 to know that the Holy Prophet is a witness over all other witnesses.\n"

His knowledge is my knowledge.\n(vi) All that concerns the faith has been entrusted to him by me.\n(vii) He is my successor, my executor and my vicegerent.\nThe hypocrites among the listeners whispered to each other that in love of Ali, Muhammad has lost his balance of mind. Then these verses were revealed.\nThe enemies of the Holy Prophet were ultimately duped and deluded, and became the laughingstock on account of their disbelief.\nMen set up false standard of judgement about men and matters. The right standard is that of Allah, because His knowledge of every thing in the universe, seen and unseen, is complete, perfect and all-embracing. He knows all hidden motives. He knows the past history in which the roots of present actions are planted as well as the future consequences of present actions. For example people praise whom they like without taking into consideration the actual worth of those who are praised. Allah praises those whom He has thoroughly purified. So, in all fairness, intelligent men must follow those whom Allah has purified and glorified.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 68:17]\nIn a township near Yemen, there was a garden owned by a God-fearing man who used to distribute its fruits among the poor and the needy. When he died two of his sons decided not to give to the poor and the needy any portion from the produce they would collect next day. They even did not say: \"If Allah wills,\" at the time of making plans to gather the harvest. The third son, who disagreed with them and wanted to do as their father used to do, was silenced by his two brothers. They kept the whole operation a closely guarded secret lest the needy came for taking what they used to get. As they did not subordinate their will to the will of Allah and decided to have all the produce exclusively for themselves, ignoring the needs of their fellow beings, the garden was destroyed altogether. Then the third son who had warned them before hand reminded them that had they remembered Allah and acted as commanded by Him they would not have lost everything. Then they turned to Allah in repentance. If the repentance is sincere, there is hope. Allah turns evil into good. If repentance is not sincere, it becomes hypocrisy. Ibn Abbas says that their repentance was true and Allah gave them a better garden which yielded abundant produce. The points allegorised in the parable of the people of the garden not only illustrate the conduct of the hypocrites but also demonstrate how Allah gives respite to the wrongdoers so that they may have the opportunity to repent and make amend at any stage before the mercy shown to them is withdrawn after which there is no remedy save eternal punishment in the hereafter.\n"

Only the ignorant think that the Quran is a fabricated book composed by the Holy Prophet. The Quran is the word of Allah sent down to mankind through the honoured prophet. See commentary of Qalam: 2 to 5.\nThose who are chosen and commissioned by Allah convey only that which they are commanded to convey. An impostor cannot carry out his fraud indefinitely. He is bound to be found out soon but a chosen prophet of Allah, however much he is persecuted, opposed and belied, gain more and more recognition from the men of understanding every day, as did the Holy Prophet whose truth, sincerity and wisdom, by the will of Allah, were recognised as his life progressed. The protection which the Holy Prophet received from Allah in circumstances of danger and difficulty, insurmountable from every material points of view, would not be available to an impostor.\nThe message of Allah is glad tidings for those who believe in Him and His prophet and follow their laws, but in the case of the unjust it is a cause of sorrow, because it denounces sin and punishes the sinners.\nAllah who knows the seen and the unseen proclaims that the Quran revealed to the Holy Prophet is the truth of assured certainty (haqqul yaqin), which can never be disproved. Truth as understood by man by the application of his power of judgement and appraisement of visible evidence through reasoning or inference is called ilmul yaqin. If he sees something with his own eyes, described as \"seeing is believing\", it is called Ayn ul yaqin which sometimes terminates in delusion or deception.\nThe absolute truth is the haqqul yaqin mentioned here. As Allah has given us this absolute truth through the Holy Prophet, we must understand it, follow it and be grateful to Him and His messenger, the Holy Prophet. We must celebrate His praises in thought, word and deed."

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 70:1]\nAbu Ishaq Thalabi, in Tafsir al Kabir, while commenting on al Ma-arij has recorded from two authentic sources the tradition that on the day of Ghadir Khum the Holy Prophet summoned the people and said: \"Ali is the mawla of whom I am mawla\" (see commentary of Ma-idah: 67). The news quickly spread over all urban and rural areas. When Harith ibn Numan al-Fahri came to know of it he rode his she-camel and came to Madina to see the Holy Prophet. When he reached his destination he made the she-camel sit, alighted from it, approached the Holy Prophet and said:\n\"You commanded us to testify that there is no god but Allah and that you are the messenger of Allah. We obeyed you. You ordered us to say prayers five times a day and we obeyed. You directed us to pay zakat and we obeyed. You ordered us to observe fasts during Ramadan and we obeyed. Then you commanded us to perform pilgrimage to kabah and we obeyed. But you are not satisfied with all this and you raised your cousin by the hand and imposed him upon us as our master by saying: 'Ali is the mawla of whom I am mawla' Is this imposition from you or from Allah?\"\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"By Allah who is the only God, this is from Allah, the mighty, the glorious.\"\nOn hearing this Harith turned back and proceeded towards his she-camel saying:\n\"O Allah, if what Muhammad says is true then fling on us a stone from the sky and make us suffer severe pain and torture.\"\nHe had not yet reached his she-camel when a stone came at him and struck him on his head, penetrated into his body and passed out through his anus leaving him dead. It was on this occasion that Allah revealed these verses of al Ma-arij.\nThis is a literal translation of the tradition recorded by Thalabi. Many eminent Muslim traditionists have copied this tradition from Thalabi, e.g., Shablanji in his book Nur al Absar on page 11; it is also mentioned in Sirat al Halabiyah, vol. 2, page 214; and Mustadrak, vol. 2, page 502.\nVerse 32 of Anfal refers to the disbelievers who denied the Quran, and these verses refer to the hypocrite who refused to accept Ali as his mawla. On both occasions immediate punishment was brought upon them.\nDhil ma-arij means the lord of the ways (or means) of ascent. Allah has given the privilege to angels and men, as man is gifted with the ruh from Allah according to Hijr: 29, to reach \"the nearness\" of Allah by developing divine attributes.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe disbelievers, as stated in the commentary of Anfal: 32, and a hypocrite as stated in these verses, demanded to experience torment from Allah, which on both occasions seized them. According to Quran punishment to the unjust, sooner or later, in some stage or other, in the course of the progress of the worldly material life to spiritual hereafter is inevitable, as stated in Waqi-ah and Haqqah.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 70:5]\nGenuine patience is without complaints, expressed or suppressed. The patience the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt exercised was contentment with and total submission to the will of Allah; because they knew and believed that whatever He does is good, so they used to bear with patience persecution and torture inflicted upon them by their enemies. They always cared for the well being of their adversaries and prayed to Allah to make them see the path of salvation. Such patience arises from the purest faith and trust in Allah. The best example of such patience, after the Holy Prophet, was demonstrated by Imam Husayn in Karbala.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 70:6]\nThe evil doers, ignorant of the laws of time and space in various realms, imagine that the retribution for their sins is so far off that it may not came at all but the theories of time as we know them are not in force in the spiritual world, so in view of the divine universal plan it may be very very near. It is bound to come and it may suddenly come at any moment. Verses 8 and 9 describe the condition of the sky and the mountains when the day of resurrection begins. The sinners will be so overcome with terror at the realisation of their horrible end that they will desert their most intimate friends, offer their children, their families and those who had protected and sheltered them, in fact everything they can, as a ransom to obtain salvation, but nothing will save them from the fire of hell.\nSin begins when man turns his back to goodness and abandons himself to greed, to the collection of unlimited riches and acquisition of countless material advantages which is almost impossible without hypocrisy, fraud and crime; thus he deprives others from the use of the resources Allah has made available for the benefit of all mankind. Man has been given freedom of action, but generally he uses this free will to make himself weak (Nisa: 28), or hasty (Banu Israil: 11) or greedy as the word halu-a suggests in this verse. In adversity he complains and despairs. In prosperity he becomes arrogant and forgets other people's rights.\nAs referred to in Hajj: 35 (see commentary) there are men who rise above the material temptations and reach sublime spiritual heights. They are those who are devoted to worship of Allah and His religion, not merely by performing certain rites and rituals, but by surrendering completely their being and will to Allah to seek His nearness and pleasure, manifesting the attributes of Allah in thoughts, words and deeds. They live the life on this earth in the interest of the life of hereafter. The perfect models of such beings are the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt. There are others also who should be recognised and respected according to the degree of their submission to the will of Allah. Refer to the commentary of Nur: 37 and Baqarah: 177.\nAccording to Imam Ali verse 23 refers to those who do not fail to do any good which they are able to do. If they fail to do it at one time they find another occasion to do it.\nHaqqun ma-lum refers to the prescribed zakat, khums and other charities which are the recognised rights of the needy in the wealth of the wealthy.\nMahrum refers to those needy who do not beg. Refer to Dhariyat: 19.\nA true fear of Allah is to safeguard oneself against evil by the awareness of the divine laws. It is therefore akin to the love of Allah. It proceeds from the realisation that all true peace and tranquillity comes from surrendering our will to and bringing it into full accord with the will of Allah. Fear of the penalty is the acknowledgement of the authority, and such obedience of the divine laws after understanding the universal divine plan and purpose of creation obtains love and pleasure of Allah which are the most superior rewards a man can aspire and achieve.\nDiscord, disorder and disobedience are the consequences of sin and evildoing which destroy peace and tranquillity, and the sinners and evildoers are deprived of mercy, pleasure and security from Allah.\nIt is essential to keep away from every kind of sex abuse.\nRefer to the commentary of Muminun: 5 and 6.\nFor \"those who fulfil their trusts and covenants\" refer to the commentary of Ma-idah: 1. For salat refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 3 and Ta Ha: 132.\nThe honoured ones in the hereafter are those who are described above.\n"

Disbelief, wickedness and evil had made deep inroads in their social lives. A purge had to be made. So the great flood put an end to their civilisation.\nBefore the final punishment prophet Nuh warned them against the consequences of their ungodliness. Had they availed the respite given to them and repented and reformed themselves, they would still have obtained mercy.\nWhen convincing arguments and warnings are given, some whose intellect is alive to reason and whose conscience is not entirely corrupted beyond recovery, receive guidance, repent, amend their lives and turn to Allah and obtain the fruits of repentance. On the other hand there are those who obstinately reject guidance and sink deep in the abyss of evil, disconnecting all links with the grace of Allah. See commentary of Bara-at: 25. As Baqarah: 10 says: There is a disease in their hearts, so Allah adds to their disease. They neither want to listen to the words of admonitions nor come before the preacher.\nWhen every effort of prophet Nuh and every promise of Allah to bestow blessings on them failed to bring them to the right path, a copious rain was sent down upon them. It flooded the country and drowned the wicked generation.\nIt is mentioned in Minhajul Sadiqin that some men came to Imam Ali and told him about their problems. One man had sinned a great deal, another did not have any child, the third was very poor. In short each was suffering some misfortune or other. To every bewailer Imam Ali said: \"Ask forgiveness from your Lord, for He is oftforgiving.\" When Ibn Abbas asked him as to why he gave the same advice to every one who had different grievances, Ali replied: \"Read verse 10 of Nuh.\"\nAccording to the authentic traditions from the Ahl ul Bayt if verses 10 and 11 are recited 100 times in the last hours of the night for a year, divine blessings will be bestowed on the reciter and his legitimate desires will be fulfilled.\nSee commentary of Hajj: 5 and Muminun: 12 to 14 for verse 14. By passing through various stages the foetus becomes a child, and after birth the child grows from one stage to another till he becomes a man and demonstrates various qualities and capacities, mental and spiritual. The creation and development of man in diverse stages, if studied scientifically, is enough to make man believe in the infinite power and wisdom of the creator Lord, Allah.\nSee commentary of Talaq: 12 and Mulk: 3 for verse 15; and Furqan: 61 for verse 16.\nIn verse 17 the evolutionary process of development of life on the earth has been referred to.\nThe five false gods worshipped by the people in the time of Nuh were as follows:\nNAME\n\nSHAPE\n\nQUALITY REPRESENTED\nWadd\n\nMan\n\nManly power\nSuwa\n\nWoman\n\nMutability, Beauty\nYaghuth\n\nLion (Or Bull)\n\nBrute strength\nYa-ub\n\nHorse\n\nSwiftness\nNasr\n\nEagle or Falcon\n\nInsight\nIt is mentioned in Minhajus Sadiqin that these gods were forgotten after the great flood but Shaytan introduced them again to the idol worshippers.\nThe message of this surah is that pagan superstitions and cults do not add to human knowledge or well-being. They only increase error, evil, corruption and injustice. When transgression exceeds all bounds a purge has to be made. The prayer of Nuh in verses 26 and 27 means: \"Cut off all the roots of sin, so that the power base of evil is destroyed.\" His prayer is not vindictive but corrective.\nIn the battle of Siffin Imam Ali told Malik Ashtar that though he was as good as Ali in exterminating the enemy soldiers but at the time of slaying a warrior Ali saw in future and spared those in whose lineage a true believer would be born. Verse 28 confirms that the parents of the prophets were believers. See commentary of Ibrahim: 41. \"Who enters my abode\" refers to the Ahl ul Bayt and \"believing men and believing women\" refers to the followers of the Ahl ul Bayt.\n "

Ali was with the Holy Prophet from the beginning of his ministry (refer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 52 and 53). He was the first person to pray salat with the Holy Prophet. It is written in Riyad al Nadrah that at the time of leaving this world the hand of the Holy Prophet was in the hand of Ali; and Ibn Sad writes: \"At the time of the Holy Prophet's death his hand was in the lap of Ali. It was Ali who performed the last rites. When he was washing his body Fazal bin Abbas held the Holy Prophet's corpse and Usamah was pouring water.\"\nThere was several authentic traditions that Ali used to pray salat with the Holy Prophet in the nights.\nMa tayassara minal Quran means whichever part of the Quran available to memory or easy to be recited. It may also mean reciting the Quran as much as one can after praying the prescribed salat. The Quran must be recited whole-heartedly and willingly, not as a mechanical ritual nor its recitation should be felt as a burden. According to Ta Ha: 2 the Quran has not been sent down on the Holy Prophet that he should be burdened or distressed. The command of Allah should be willingly complied with.\n\"Fighting in Allah's cause\" refers to Jihad. So this verse was revealed in Madina. The reference to prescribed salat and zakat points to the same conclusion. For \"the goodly loan\" refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 245; Ma-idah: 12; Hadid: 11 and 18 and Taghabun 17.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThis verse explains verses 2 and 3.\n\"A party of those with you\" refers to Ali and Abu Dhar according to authentic traditions.\nAs this verse deals with the command which makes easy praying of tahajjud salat the recitation of the Quran refers to its portions to be recited in the said salat.\nThe first and the last verses, if studied together, make it clear that though the night prayer (tahajjud) is highly desirable, yet is not obligatory. There is no compulsion to recite a complete surah in it, whereas in obligatory prayers recitation of a complete surah is compulsory.\nAllah knew that if night prayer (tahajjud) was made compulsory a large number of believers would not be able to comply with the command, therefore, from the very beginning it was left to the discretion of the believers.

In the end he died in utter misery, disgrace and poverty.\nThere are Walids in all ages.

Then the Holy Prophet came to see them and advised Ali and Fatimah to make a promise to Allah that they would observe fasts for three consecutive days if their sons got well. Soon they returned to normal health. So Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, Husayn and Fizza fasted three successive days. Each day a different person came at the time of breaking the fast and knocked at the door. The man who came on the first day said:\n\"O Ahl ul Bayt of the messenger of Allah, I am a poor man. l am hungry Give me something to eat.\"\nAll that was there to eat was given away to him. All of them used water to break their fasts and went to sleep without food.\nThe man who came on the second day said:\n\"O Ahl ul Bayt of the messenger of Allah, my parents are dead. I am a destitute. Will you satisfy my hunger?\"\nAll that was there to eat was given away to him. All of them used water to break their fasts and went to sleep without food.\nThe man who came the third day said:\n\"O Ahl ul Bayt of the messenger of Allah, I am a just-now-freed slave. Give me some food.\"\nAll that was there to eat was given away to him. All of them used water to break their fasts and went to sleep without food.\nAfter completion of three fasts when Hasan and Husayn became well again, Fatimah offered prayers of thankfulness to Allah; and then the Holy Prophet informed her that Jibrail had brought these verses in their praise.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nIf in hubbihi (for the love of Him) in verse 8 the pronoun \"Him\" refers to Allah the phrase would be adverbial modifying yatimuna; and if it refers to ta-am (food) then the phrase would be adjectival qualifying food, meaning: inspite of the food being wanted for themselves-in view of verse 92 of Ali Imran this interpretation is preferable. However both the interpretations are valid and convey the same significance..\nVerses 9 and 10 express the true motives of pious and unpretentious charity spoken by the Ahl ul Bayt to guide mankind that service in the way of Allah should be selfless and without the expectation of reward or thankfulness.\nLight of beauty and bliss is reserved for the Ahl ul Bayt. Those who love them (Shura: 23) and follow their teachings will also earn the bliss according to the degree of their submission, obedience and love. They shall be kept safe from the evil of the day of judgement. Refer to the commentary of Hajj: 22.\n"

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 78:1]\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nNaba-il azim (the great news) here and in verse 67 of Sad, refers to the vicegerency of man to represent Allah on the earth in order to exercise authority on His behalf, i.e. imamah or wilayah.\nAccording to many commentators it may refer to the day of resurrection, or the prophethood of the Holy Prophet, or the Quran. Refer to my arguments given in the commentary of Sad: 67. Although all of them are great and fundamental yet discussion, opposition or disagreement among the human beings concerning their actuality is a regular exercise. So far as the angelical realm is concerned we find no trace of any such behaviour save at the time of the appointment of Adam (man) as the vicegerent (khalifah) of Allah. The angels expressed their disapproval, but yielded to reason when it was proved to them that they were inferior to Adam in knowledge and wisdom because of which Adam was appointed as the vicegerent of Allah. So it was the beginning of controversy regarding the vicegerency of Allah. In every age imamah or wilayah is the most bitterly disputed issue.\nEven those who believe in Allah, the revealed scriptures, the angels, the resurrection and the prophets of Allah refuse to accept the fact that there is always a divinely chosen representative of Allah on the earth who by his absolute submission to Allah (abdiyat) and total control over human shortcomings reaches the stage of fanafiallah (absolute absorption of divine attributes) and baqiya-billah (acting on behalf of Allah as His instrument) as explained in the commentary of Ma-idah: 54 to 58 and Anam: 17.\nHafiz Abu Nu-aym in Hilyatul Awliya says that the Holy Prophet told his companions: \"Naba-il-azim (the great news) refers to the wilayah of Ali ibn abi Talib.\"\nRefer to the commentary of Ma-idah: 67 for the wilayah of Ali ibn abi Talib. Therefore wilayah of Imam Ali is the decisive test of man's submission to Allah's authority. Man shall not be able to avoid or escape from acceptance of Ali's wilayah as verses 4 and 5 assert.\nIn subsequent verses the process of creation demonstrates the evidence of divine plan and purpose which shall culminate in resurrection after which a new world will come into being. The process of developing matter from its lowest form to the highest form, which is human form, has to be carried out by the help of a pivotal entity to function as a medium between the finite and the infinite. Not only in the human society functioning in this world but also in the greater society which will come into being after the day of judgement the pivotal agency is indispensable. In fact the centre of gravitation of any collective existence has to be created before its formation. On this basis imamah or khilafat was bestowed on man and then the human race began to spread over the world and it shall continue to function till the human society reaches its final destination.\nIbn Arabi has rightly observed:\n\"The day of resurrection and wilayah of Ali ibn abi Talib are the two sides of one reality.\"\nAli is \"the great news\". He is the ark of Nuh. In him and in every Imam in his progeny is confined all that which has been created (Ya Sin: 12). Khawja Muinuddin Chishti, a great saint of India, has said: \"Those who sought protection through \"Ya Sin\" killed the imamun mabin\".\nSo he clearly says that \"imamum mabin\" in verse 12 of Ya Sin refers to Imam Husayn son of Ali ibn abi Talib. It refers to all the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt. Also see commentary of Baqarah: 2 and Ya Sin: 12.\nImam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir said:\n\"Naba-il azim refers to Ali ibn abi Talib\".\nAlqama says that in the battle of Siffin a soldier came out from the army of Mu-awiyah and recited Ya Sin in front of Imam Ali. He asked him: \"Do you know what is naba-il-azim ?\" He did not know. Ali said: \"I am the naba-il azim.\" A similar event also took place in the battle of Jamal.\nAmr ibn As, an avowed enemy of Ali, once said:\n\"Ali is the naba-il azim. He is the babullah (the door through which one enters into the realm of the realisation of Allah).\"\nRefer to the commentary of Ma-arij: 1 to know about the fate of those who did not accept the wilayah of Ali ibn abi Talib. Also refer to the commentary of Ma-idah: 67 and 3.\n"

For example the worst among them will take the form of dogs and swines-the body will be a manifestation of soul.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 80:1]\nOne day when the Holy Prophet was in conversation with some of his companions, a blind man, Abdullab ibn Ummi Maktum, who was also poor, came to meet him and learn the Quran. The Holy Prophet received him with kindness and asked him to sit beside him. The Quraysh leaders did not like the interruption, particularly the respect and honour given to him by the Holy Prophet. One of the companions frowned and turned his back on him, which displeased Allah, and this surah was revealed.\nSome commentators say that the pronoun \"he\" in abasa refers to the Holy Prophet who disliked the interruption at a time when he was engrossed in earnest discourse with some of the pagan Quraysh leaders.\nAs has been mentioned in the commentary of many verses, particularly Baqarah: 78; Mumin: 55; Fat-h: 2 and Muhammad: 15 to 19, a large number of Muslim scholars try to find out imaginary weaknesses in the character of the Holy Prophet so as to minimise the actual shortcomings, deviation and waywardness found in the companions whom they present as heroes of Islam. It is a preconceived plan to bring the infallible status of the Holy Prophet to the ordinary level of temporal rulers, which has been fully exposed in the commentary of above noted verses. For the perfection bestowed on the Holy Prophet refer to the commentary of Ahzab: 21 and Qalam: 4.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe commentators who have depended on the sources, other than the Ahl ul Bayt, say that the nominative pronoun in verse 1, the subjective pronoun in verse 2, and the pronouns in verses 3, 6, 7 and 8 refer to the Holy Prophet. It is a deliberate attempt to belie the infallibility of the Holy Prophet.\nTo know the reason see commentary of verses mentioned above. According to the Ahl ul Bayt all the pronouns refer to a companion who was present there and frowned in anger as soon as Abdullah ibn Ummi Maktum sat beside the Holy Prophet. If, as said by such commentators, the Holy Prophet was deeply and earnestly engrossed in explaining the right path to pagan leaders whose conversion he had long cherished and did not pay attention to a man who had already embraced Islam, then this act should not have been censured by Allah.\nThe question in verse 3 clearly indicates that the doubt \"whether Abdullah would grow in knowledge if the Holy Prophet talked to him\" could only creep into the mind of a person whose faith was not fully strengthened. It could never come to the mind of a messenger of Allah who had been sent to preach the religion of Allah to one and all, irrespective of the listener's worldly position.\nVerse 4 asserts that it is more likely that a poor man on account of his will to learn may grow in his spiritual development more than a wealthy leader who was proud of his possessions, referred to in verse 5, and it was he who frowned in anger (in verse 1). The wealthy companion who looked down upon Abdullah is commanded to let the poor companion be attended to because the message of Allah is accepted by the poor and lowly at once, and the mighty ones of the earth only come in when the weak and the simple people become an irresistible force. Even if a poor man does not grow in knowledge there is no blame on any one. Attention should be paid to those who come to learn with a sincere longing for knowledge. The wealthy companion, in spite of receiving guidance from the Holy Prophet, was unmindful of the preferences of Allah.\nThe Quran has been revealed to guide the whole mankind from which no one is to be excluded, rich or poor, great or lowly, learned or ignorant. Those who show sincere earnestness must be given preference.\n"

So the witnesses are the Holy Prophet, the prophets of Allah and the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt all of whom always preached goodness and invited people to follow the right path and because of whom they came to know what was good and how to follow the right path. As the recording commenced with the creation, only those who existed right from the beginning are the witnesses nearest to Allah.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 85:4]\nIn every age there were people who believed in Allah and the truth, did good deeds and opposed tyranny and despotism, so the tyrants persecuted the righteous servants of Allah. In Arab tradition there is the story of Ibrahim whom Nimrud tried to burn to death (see Anbiya: 51 to 70). Another case cited is that of Zu-Nuwas. The true events concerning him and those whom he persecuted have been narrated by Imam Ali as follows:\n\"Allah sent a prophet to the people of Abyssinia. Zu Nuwas, the king, was a pagan and asked the people to worship him as their god. The prophet prevented the people from worshipping him. The king killed many of the companions of the prophet and arrested him along with a few remaining believers. A huge pit of burning fire was prepared and it was announced that whoso believed in the God whom the prophet worshipped should jump into that pit. A believing woman came with a baby in her arms but stopped at the eleventh hour on account of her love for her child. The child cried (as Allah willed so): \"Mother, jump into the fire with me. It is a test to prove our faith in Allah.\" She jumped and the prophet along with his remaining followers also jumped into the fire. By Allah's command all of them were saved from the fire.\nThe words are no doubt general but the reference can very appropriately be construed to be the persecution to which the Ahl ul Bayt and their followers were subjected by the rulers who usurped power after the departure of the Holy Prophet.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe Quran condemns not only the cruel persecutors but also those who witnessed the cruelties and did not take steps to prevent persecution, nor even said a word of disapproval. It was a warning to the pagans of Makka who were persecuting those who accepted Islam as their religion. It also refers to those who persecuted and killed the Imams of the Ahl ul Bayt and their followers.\nIn Ziyarat Imam Husayn it is said:\n\"O Allah, curse those who persecuted you, and also those who hear about it and remain agreeable to it, or rejoice.\"\nThe persecutors who inflicted cruelty on men for their faith in Allah deserve to be punished in the fire of hell.\n"

If it was possible that he could forget any of his duties, the people would not have been commanded by Allah to follow and obey him. The Holy Prophet is protected from forgetting his duties.\nIt is said in verse 108 of Hud that those who will be blessed shall abide in paradise so long as the heavens and the earth survive except if Allah wills otherwise. Although Allah has the power to do what He wills but the exception mentioned may not be willed as His grace once willed will not be reversed in the life of hereafter. The exception in these verses is similar to the exception mentioned in the above noted verse.\n"

The cases where admonition produces positive benefits and where it does not, are mentioned in verses 10 and 11. When the message of Allah is proclaimed, it creates positive response in those in whose hearts is the fear of Allah, which those who run away from it, reject and belie it prepare their own ruin. They will be thrown into the fire of hell where they will neither die nor live. See commentary of Ta Ha: 74. Those in whose hearts is the fear of Allah purify their souls by not disobeying or revolting against the commands of Allah, and by submitting their souls to the will of Allah, and never going astray from the path of righteousness. They are those who really glorify the name of their most high Lord as mentioned in verse 1. The transgressors prefer the life of this world but those who have purified their souls know that the blessings of the hereafter are for ever with which they will be rewarded by Allah.\nRefer to the commentary of Ibrahim: 4. Godliness and righteousness have been preached to mankind in all ages. They have been renewed and reiterated again and again. All the prophets of Allah came to convey the message of Allah. Some paid attention and accepted the truth and some rejected and rebelled against it.\nThere must have been some testament of Ibrahim, which like so many other scriptures is now lost to the world. A book, said to be apocryphal, entitled the Testament of Abraham was translated from the Greek original and published for the first time in 1892, at Cambridge, by M. R. James.\nThe book of Musa referred to here is the original Tawrat. The present Pentateuch is a man-made revision (see page 374)."

More often the owner would at once rush to his house and snatch the fallen dates from the hands of the children and sometimes even from their mouths. The poor man went to the Holy Prophet and asked for his advice. The Holy Prophet asked the owner if he would give him the tree in exchange for a tree in paradise. The owner did not accept the offer. Abu Huddah said: \"O messenger of Allah, if you promise me the same I will buy the tree and give it to you.\" The Holy Prophet agreed. Abu Huddah purchased that tree and presented it to the Holy Prophet who gave it to the poor man. The occasion of revelation of any verse does not restrict its significance. The word of Allah is applicable in all times.\nImam Jafar bin Muhammad as Sadiq said:\n\"Good deeds along with sincere belief in Allah and His religion shall obtain salvation and eternal happiness in the hereafter.\"\n"

If he chooses to go astray and live an evil life, belying Allah's messengers, guides, laws and commands, a fire blazing fiercely will be his eternal abode.

Such believers give charity and do good deeds to seek pleasure of Allah only, not with the motive that they are returning someone else's favour and compensating someone for some service done to them, or expecting some reward in return for their good deeds. Allah is the source of their goodness, as its goal or purpose.\nAtqa is the superlative degree of taqi.

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 93:3]\nAllah never forsakes His devoted servants, much less His prophets and messengers. Thus verse 3 contradicts the reported cry of agony of Isa: \"My God, why have You forsaken me\". (Mark 15: 34 and Matthew 27: 46).\nIn the beginning of the ministry of the Holy Prophet there was a short interval during which he received no revelation. The pagans jeered at him as one forsaken by Allah, and slandered and persecuted him as well as those who believed in him, but his faith in Allah was never shaken and he never thought that Allah was not pleased with him, as the talents of his enemies suggested. He was not in need of any assurance to dispel the feelings of loneliness which might have weighed on his mind as some commentators try to interpret. Nevertheless this verse was revealed to put an end to the mischievous speculations of the enemies of Allah and the Holy Prophet.\nThe Jews of Madina were aware of the prophesy of the advent of the Holy Prophet written in the Tawrat and the Injil, so they advised the pagans of Makka to ask the following questions from him:\n(i) Who were as-habul kahf?\n(ii) Who was Dhul Qarnayn?\n(iii) What is soul?\nAs the Holy Prophet never said anything save that which he was commanded to say by Allah (Najm; 3 to 6), he waited for the revelation to give the answers. The answers were revealed to him after three days. In the meantime the pagans indulged in the mischievous speculations mentioned above. He told them that he would give answers only when he received them through revelation. His dependence and reliance upon Allah's will was unshakeable. All other interpretations are mere conjectures.\nThough external hindrances used to come in the Holy Prophet's way but he was always confident of the success of his divine mission. Real greatness in this world and the hereafter belongs to him. Material gains were not the source of satisfaction for him. It is the right of intercession on behalf of his followers, granted to him, which pleased him the most. He said at several occasions that it would grieve him much if even one soul fails to obtain the eternal bliss. So as promised all the divine attributes of Allah were received by the thoroughly purified Holy Prophet which he manifested to mankind as the true vicegerent of Allah. In spite of ups and downs he constantly progressed unto infinite perfection as said in verse 8. See commentary of Ta Ha: 114, Bani Israil: 1 and Najm: 1 to 10.\nJalal al Din al Suyuti writes in Tafsir Durr al Manthur that the Holy Prophet, as soon as he received this surah, verse 5, went to Fatimah Zahra's house and recited the glad tidings given in verse 5 to her. His happiness knew no bounds when he was given the authority to intercede on behalf of those whom he found suitable for receiving pardon of Allah.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAn unequivocal assurance is given to the Holy Prophet that whatever satisfies him will be given to him. Verses 6 to 8 say that he was always under the constant care and protection of Allah. In all these verses \"He found him\" is mentioned with the conjunctive particle fa which is used to say that as soon as Allah found him in any condition an action was taken as a consequence without any lapse of time between His finding and the action taken. There cannot be any gap or lapse of time between the creation of Muhammad and the grant of wisdom and guidance to him as well as availability of full satisfaction to his needs from the commencement of his existence in physical as well as in spiritual realms. So verses 2 to 10 of Najm and verses 1 to 4 of Rahman confirm these verses that the Holy Prophet is infallible.\nVerse 6 refers to the divine protection arranged for the Holy Prophet when his father Abdullah died before he was born and his mother died when he was only six years old. His grandfather Abdul Muttalib died two years later. Thereafter his uncle Abu Talib loved him, protected him and brought him up as his own son. See commentary of Bara-at : 113. Thus the protection given by Allah to the Holy Prophet was through Abu Talib; and so when the pagan Arabs joined hands to oppose the Holy Prophet, in the process of their hostile scheming and plotting they included Abu Talib also. In the most adverse conditions which the Holy Prophet faced in the beginning of his divine mission Abu Talib stood like a \"cemented wall\" to protect him and while going away from this world gave his son, Ali, to him as the most trustworthy, reliable and unconquerable defender of the faith and the preacher of the faith. The history of Islam is a witness to the singular services Ali rendered to protect the Holy Prophet and his mission.\nImam Ali bin Musa ar Rida said that the word yatim, in this verse means lonely or unattended.\nThe character of the Holy Prophet was, even in his childhood and youth, exemplary and exceptional in the most wayward environment of Makka as is borne out by even his worst enemies. He remained aloof from the coarse and licentious practices of the young around him. Living in the midst of the worst idolatry and polytheism of Makka, reserved and meditative, endowed with refinement, truthfulness and utmost honesty, he earned the titles, by common consent, of al amin and as sadiq. He was under the constant guidance and care of Allah. So there is no implication whatever of error or fallibility on his part. The Arabic root dalla (in verse 7) has various shades of meaning. Here it does not mean astray or ignorant but in view of the occasion of revelation it should be translated \"lost\". While taking the Holy Prophet to his grandfather, his nurse Halimah left him by the roadside and went inside the desert to clean herself. When she came back the child was not there. After receiving the news from Halimah, Abdul Muttalib, with his friends and relatives, conducted a thorough search but the Holy Prophet was not traceable. Halimah, while making her own queries, met an old man in the precinct of Ka-bah and asked him: \"Where is Muhammad?\" It is said that when the name of the Holy Prophet was pronounced the idols fell on the ground in Ka-bah. In the meantime Abdul Muttalib arrived there with his men and invoked Allah's help to find out the Holy Prophet. A voice announced: \"Go to the valley of Tahamah. He is there.\" Then Warqa bin Nawfil came and told Abdul Muttalib that he saw the boy in the valley of Tahamah. They at once went there and found the Holy Prophet playing with the branches of a tree. The Holy Prophet, whom his grandfather had not seen since his birth, told him: \"I am Muhammad\" He took him in his arms and embraced him for a long time. This verse refers to the event mentioned above.\nVerse 7 also implies that the knowledge the Holy Prophet possessed was perfect because he never acquired knowledge from any mortal but was taught by Allah Himself. See commentary of Baqarah: 78; Rahman: 2 to 4 and Najm: 2 to 10. Imam Ali bin Musa ar Rida said:\n\"The Holy Prophet was lost in the ignorance of the people, so Allah brought his light among them in order to guide them to have true knowledge about him.\"\nVerses 2 of Najm clearly asserts that he had never gone astray, so the word dalla cannot be translated as wandering or going astray.\nSome commentators wrongly interpret this verse to say that the wealth of Khadija Kubra made him independent of worldly needs, enabling him to devote his whole life to the service of Allah. Actually independence refers to the \"self-sufficiency\" which Allah had bestowed on His most beloved prophet.\n"

The equally weighty or important task is the establishment, continuation and perpetuation of the guidance of Allah (see commentary of Qasas: 51, by nominating and appointing his successor who shall act as a guardian and exponent of all that he has conveyed and preached.

When such slanderous and censorious observations appear in books and magazines, the Muslim ummah makes a hue and cry in a violent frenzy, without realising the fact that it is their own historians and commentators who have supplied the material on which the conclusions are made by the anti-muslim authors. The life of the Holy Prophet, from his birth to the end, has been described by Imam Ali ibn abi Talib at several places in the Nahj al Balagha, which is the most authentic point of view expressed by any of his biographers till today. The Holy Prophet was taught and tutored by Allah Himself, as stated in Rahman and Najm. He was under the divine care all the time. Since his birth he was fully alive to the task of preaching and conveying the divine message for which he was chosen when Adam was not even created. He was a light, though he lived like a human among people, blessed with divine wisdom, mercy and guidance in order to guide the human beings in all times. See Nisa: 79, Ahzab: 45 to 47; Saba: 28 and Anbiya: 107. According to Najm 9 he was as perfect as his Lord with a fine line of demarcation between the finite and the infinite, on account of which we say in \"tashahhud\" of every salat that \"he is the servant and the messenger of Allah.\"\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"My light was created when Adam was not even in the process of creation.. I and Ali were created from one and the same light.\"\nIqra (read, recite or proclaim) implies that the Holy Prophet knew all the names of Allah which carry the essence of creation and legislation. So he knew the book of Allah also. As said in verses 77 to 79 of Waqi-ah the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt alone, in addition to Allah, are aware of the book kept well-guarded in lawh mahfuz. Here he was commanded to recite or read which he already knew. It was the beginning of the gradual revelation. See Ta Ha: 114 and Qiyamah: 16 to 19. Verse 3 repeats the command to recite, and verses 4 and 5 say that Allah has already taught everything which if read with Rahman: 1 to 4 clearly implies that the Holy Prophet who was sent as rahmatun lil alamin (mercy unto the worlds), representing the universal divine grace, was taught by Arrahman as soon as he was created. Thus bi-that does not mean the beginning of his prophethood, but it refers to the beginning of his ministry.\n"

Man is reminded of his lowly origin and his responsibility when he finally returns to his Lord. These verses are applicable generally to perverse disbelievers who not only rebel against Allah's law, but also prevent others from following it. In particular these verses refer to Abu Jahl, an inveterate enemy of Islam, who used to insult and persecute the Holy Prophet and those who followed his teaching. In verse 10 \"he (who) prays\" refers to the Holy Prophet.\nMan's insolence leads to self-destruction through self-misleading and false directions to others. Abu Jahls, in every age, destroy themselves by belying the truth and by not following the right guidance. Often Shaytan appears in the form of Abu Jahls, so not to be misled by the disguised beguiler, the true believer must examine the claim of the leadership of every candidate before accepting him as his guide or Imam.\nThe forelock is on the forehead, and is thus symbolical of the summit of the man's power and dignity. To be dragged by it is to surer the lowest degree of disgrace. Allah is watching Abu Jahls in all times. They will be dragged by their forelocks and will be thrown in the fire of hell on the day of judgement.\n\"A lying, sinful forelock\" is the description of Abu Jahl who had the full support of the pagan Quraysh, but they could not, all combined, prevent the onward march of the divine mission led by the Holy Prophet, though they did all they could to check it.\nAll the combined forces of evil, though they had worldly possessions at their disposal, and though they seemed to be successful for a time, could not stand against the party of Allah. The forces at His command subdue evil and protect His party.\nThe righteous believer has no fear. He disregards all the forces of evil, bows down in adoration to Allah only and seeks His nearness and pleasure at all events. His humility and surrender to Allah keep him safe from insolent rebellion and bring him near to Him.\nSajdah is compulsory after reciting or listening to verse 19."

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 97:1]\nQadr is power, honour, glory, grandeur.\nRefer to the commentary of Dukhan: 3 to 6 and references mentioned therein to have a clear understanding about the doctrine of determinism propagated by a large number of Muslim schools of thought; and also the true, rational and Islamic article of faith based on divine adl (justice) presented by the Ahl ul Bayt that man has been given a free wil1 to do good or do evil on the basis of which or as a consequence of which he will be examined on the day of judgement. Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 2 on page 20; and 5 on page 24; and 21 on page 55.\nLaylatil Qadr means the night of power or grandeur. As verses 2 and 3 suggest it is, in the spiritual sense, a secret kept hidden, and it transcends time because in it Allah's power dispels the darkness of ignorance through His revelation.\nJalal al Din al Suyuti, in Durr al Manthur, says that laylatil qadr stands for the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe night of qadr is in the month of Ramadan. See Baqarah: 185 and Dukhan: 1 to 3 wherein it is stated that the whole Quran was revealed in this night. The descension of the angels and the spirit is a regular occurrence since the creation of Allah till the day of resurrection, and the place of descent is a thoroughly purified heart (Ahzab: 33). Therefore there should be such a purified heart in existence at all times.\nImam Muhammad bin Ali al Baqir said:\n\"Present this surah as a decisive argument for the continuity of the divine vicegerency on the earth.\"\nThe 19th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th night of Ramadan is the night of qadr.\nThe whole Quran was revealed to the Holy Prophet in this night but he used to recite or convey to the people only such passages or verses as he was commanded by Allah through Jibrail. It is known as gradual revelation. Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 2 and Aqa Puya's essay \"The Genuineness of the Holy Quran\".\nVerse 2 suggests that the spiritual nature of this night and its value is known to Allah only.\nQuoting Sajdah: 4, 5 and Ma-arij: 4, Abdullah Yusuf Ali says that \"a thousand months\" refers to \"timeless time\". One moment of enlightenment under Allah's light is better than thousands of months or years of animal life, and such a moment converts the night of darkness into a period of spiritual glory.\nThe Imams of Ahl ul Bayt have asked their followers to pray to Allah and invoke His forgiveness and blessings during the night of Qadr.\nIt is said that angels and holy spirits descend on the earth with peace and special blessings from Allah for those who seek Allah's mercy and bounties through prayers and supplications during this night. In the month of Ramadan the believers fast, pray and do good, therefore Allah sends down His forgiveness, mercy and blessings on those believers who obey His commands, and the boon of blessings and bounties promised to the sincere devotees of Allah continues until the rising of the dawn.\nWhen the spiritual darkness is dispelled by the light from Allah, a sense of security and peace dawns on the soul."

			"text":"[Pooya/Ali Commentary 105:1]\nThis surah refers to an incident in the history of Makka, as an example of how Allah deals with those who oppose His will. About fifty days before the birth of the Holy Prophet, Abraha, the Abyssinia's viceroy of Yemen, Christian by religion, proceeded against Makka, as the head of a large army, with the object of destroying the Ka-bah, because he wanted that there should be no place or structure more glorious than the church he was building at Sana. He had with him elephants. Therefore he and his army is known as ashab al fil, those who brought elephants. At the outskirts of Makka he captured a large number of camels belonging to the chief of Makka, Abd al Muttalib, the grandfather of the Holy Prophet. After receiving the information that Abraha was coming to destroy the holy Ka-bah, Abd al Muttalib went to see him and said:\n\"I have come to collect my camels. The Ka-bah belongs to God. He will surely protect it from your evil design.\"\nAbraha gave the captured camels to Abd al Muttalib He returned to the city and asked the people to retire to the neighbouring hills, leaving the Lord of Ka-bah to protect it. When Abraha entered Makka, suddenly a large flock of birds, like swallows, came flying from the sea-coast and pelted the invading army with pebbles of baked clay. They all died. They were like a dead and useless field from which all the produce is eaten up and only straw with stubble is left. Abraha escaped and went directly to the king in Abyssinia. All the way a bird with a stone in her beak followed him. When the king asked Abraha as to what kind of birds they were, Abraha looked to the sky and the bird at once dropped stone in her beak and killed him on the spot.\nThe lesson to be drawn is twofold. The pagans of Makka were forewarned that as the Holy Prophet was superior to the Ka-bah, Allah, who protects whatever is His own, shall protect him from all their evil schemes. It is also a warning to men in all ages that \"if a man intoxicated with power comes out to defeat Allah's holy plan, he cannot prevail against Allah, but his plan will fail and destroy him as well.\"\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThe event narrated in this surah is a miracle. It proves the sanctity of the Ka-bah and the strong faith of Abd al Muttalib, the grandfather of the Holy Prophet, in Allah. When this chapter of the Quran was recited by the Holy Prophet before the Quraysh unbelievers no one raised any voice to belie him.\nRefer to the commentary of chapters ad Duha and al Inshirah for the inter-relation of those two chapters and of al Fil and al Quraysh, the next chapter.\nThe faith of Abd al Muttalib in the oneness of Allah is proved by his following supplication:\nO Lord, there is no hope (of receiving help from any quarter) to stop them (Abraha's army) save from You,\nO Lord, therefore do not let them have Your protection because he who is the enemy of Your house is Your enemy,\nVerily they (the enemies whoever they are) cannot defeat Your power."

They were the descendants of prophet Ibrahim through his son Ismail. The custody of the sacred shrine of the Ka-bah enabled them to obtain covenants of security from the rulers of neighbouring countries on all sides on account of which they travelled to Syria in summer, and to Yemen in winter, to carry out their trade. Their trade caravans enriched them, united them, and drew people from distant parts to visit Makka, to bring and take from there merchandise of various kinds.\nThis honour and advantage they owed to their position as servants of the sacred house. They owed it to Allah. It was therefore right and fitting that they should worship Allah alone and accept as true the religion of Allah, Islam, brought by the Holy Prophet.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nAs stated in the commentary of Inshirah although the surahs al Fil and al Quraysh are separated by bismillahir rahmanir rahim, they are one, the latter is supplementary to the former."

Here it means the day of judgement as in Fatihah: 3.\nThose who deny the principles of right and wrong and man's accountability, in the moral and spiritual sense, of actions done by him treat the helpless with contempt and lead arrogant selfish lives which, as a consequence, disturbs and upsets peace and harmony in the society. As the noble virtue of loving and taking care of the helpless among the society is beyond the reach of the callous disbelievers, they discourage or forbid or look down upon the virtue of charity or kindness in others.\nTrue worship does not consist in the mere form of prayer, without the heart and mind being earnestly applied to seek the pleasure of Allah. In Islam prayer is not a ritual. Verse 142 of Nisa says: \"When they stand up for prayer they stand without sincerity, to be seen by men (only for show), but little do they (pay attention) to Allah in remembrance.\" Hypocrites make a great show of insincere acts of goodness, devotion and charity.\nSee commentary of Baqarah: 3, 43, 45 and Ta Ha : 132 for salat.\nThe Holy Prophet said:\n\"He who gives salt to a needy person earns the reward of setting free 60 slaves; and he who gives water to a needy person earns the reward of saving a man from death and destruction.\"\nLittle acts of neighbouring kindnesses, courtesies and supply of needs to the needy cost little but mean much."

This surah was revealed to give glad tidings to the Holy Prophet that abundance of unbounded grace, wisdom and knowledge, mercy and goodness, spiritual power and insight, in highest degrees, and of progeny has been given to him.\nIt is mentioned in Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Musnad of Ahmad ibn Hambal and other books of renowned Sunni scholars that the Holy Prophet said:\n\"Kawthar is a stream of super excellence, exclusively belonging to me. Only the righteous believers (among my followers) will be allowed to drink from it. Ali shall distribute the water from it to them.\nOn the day of judgement I will see some of my companions driven, like cattle, away from Kawthar. It will be announced that they are those who, after my departure from the world, deviated from the true religion and introduced innovations (based upon conjecture) to corrupt the faith.\"\nFrom that day Ali was known and referred to by the companions as saqi al kawthar.\nKawthar also means abundance of descendants. The countless descendants of the Imams of the Ah ul Bayt, in the progeny of Ali and Fatimah are known as sayyids. They are the descendants of the Holy Prophet.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nThis chapter guarantees abundance in every type of growth and profit to the Holy Prophet.\nIn gratitude of the grant of \"abundance\", the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt demonstrated highest standard of devotion in prayers and in giving everything they had in the cause of Allah. The sacrifice of Imam Husayn, his grandson, has been described as dhibin azim in verse 107 of Saffat (see commentary 3. For their salat see commentary of Baqarah: 3, 43, 45; Ta Ha: 132.\nIn some degree or other, according to the grade of their submission, all the believing men and women receive some portion from the \"abundance\" given to the Holy Prophet, therefore they are commanded to pray salat regularly and sacrifice whatever they have in the cause of Allah whenever necessary.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nNahr, in verse 2, means sacrifice. It may also mean \"raising of hands\" in prayer whenever Allahu akbar is said.\nIn verse 3 it is said that the enemies of the Holy Prophet (and his Ahl ul Bayt as explained in the commentary of Baqarah: 2 to 5, page 51) will be lost in oblivion. It is a divine prophesy."

The Holy Prophet resisted all appeals to worldly motives, and stood firm to his message of eternal unity of Allah. This surah breathes a spirit of uncompromising abhorrence to idolatry. There can be no common ground between the worship of \"the one\" and the many- monotheism and polytheism. Refer to Baqarah: 256;Yunus: 41."

All the conspiracies, intrigues and plots of the Makkans and their allies to destroy the Holy Prophet and his mission recoiled on their own heads. Gradually all the people of Arabia rallied round him and the bloodless conquest of Makka was the conclusion of his patient and constant striving in the cause of Allah-a promise made by Allah ultimately fulfilled. Those who had hitherto held aloof, then hastened to offer their allegiance to the religion of Allah. Delegations flocked from near and far to offer obedience to the Holy Prophet. Gibbon refers to it as \"one of the most memorable revolutions which have impressed a new and lasting character on the nations of the globe\". The expansion of Islam is the most miraculous of all miracles.

He has fulfilled His promised and helped His servant.\"\nInside the Ka-bah he pointed to each of the 360 idols with his staff reciting: \"Truth has come and falsehood has vanished\"-Bani Israil: 82-and the idol fell down on its face. The great idol named Hubal was fixed on a high position beyond reach. To destroy it, the Holy Prophet asked Ali to mount on his shoulders. Ali mounted as was desired and standing over the shoulders of the Holy Prophet wrenched the idol and threw it, to the ground. It crashed to pieces. Refer to Madarij al Nabuwa, Habib al Siyar; Sharh Mawahib, Rawdat al Ahbab.\nAs stated by the Holy Prophet to Ibn Abbas this verse gave a hint to his departure from this world."

Refer to the commentary of Ali Imran: 52 and 53 for\ndawat dhil ashira in which he flared up and shouted at the Holy Prophet, saying: \"Perdition to you\". He made it his business to torment the Holy Prophet; and his wife, Umm Jumail, sister of Abu Sufyan, took pleasure in carrying thorny bushes and strewing them in the sand where she knew that the Holy Prophet was sure to walk\nbarefooted, because of which she is referred to as the bearer of the wood. Abu Lahab used to persuade the people to throw stones at the Holy Prophet, whenever he passed the streets of Makka, by telling them that he was a mad man. The two hands he used to throw stones at the Holy Prophet are cursed. The two hands of Abu Lahab may also refer to the evil deeds he had sent forth which condemns him to suffer severest punishment till eternity. Neither his wealth nor his supporters will be able to save him from the blazing fire.\nA week after the battle of Badr, Abu Lahab perished, consumed with grief and his own fiery passions. The angel of death strangled his wife with the rope she used to wear around her neck. On the day of judgement the fire of punishment like a rope of iron strongly twisted will be put on her neck.\nAqa Mahdi Puya says:\nNo relationship whatsoever, even with the Holy Prophet, can be of any advantage to the disbeliever. Abu Lahab, an uncle of the Holy Prophet, will burn in the blazing fire. On the contrary, it is noticeable, that Salman, a Persian outsider, through his faith and submission to Allah, the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt achieved the highest distinction of being included in the Ahl ul Bayt."
